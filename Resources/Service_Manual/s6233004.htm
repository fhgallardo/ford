<ol start="1"><li>Make sure the engine is cool.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Wrap a thick cloth around the coolant pressure relief cap on the degas bottle. Slowly turn the cap counterclockwise (left) until the pressure begins to release.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Step back while the pressure releases.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>When you are sure all the pressure has been released, use the cloth to turn and remove the cap.

<ol start="5"><li>Place a suitable container below the radiator draincock. Drain the coolant.

<ul type="disc"><li>Tighten the radiator draincock when finished.

In order to obtain these protections, the engine coolant must be maintained at the correct
concentration and fluid level.

<br><br>When adding engine coolant, use a 50/50 mixture of distilled water and engine coolant.

<br><br>To maintain the integrity of the coolant and the cooling system:

<ul type="disc"><li>Do not add orange-colored Motorcraft Specialty Orange Engine Coolant VC-2 or equivalent meeting Ford specification WSS-M97B44-D. Mixing coolants may degrade the coolant's corrosion protection.
</li><li>Do not add alcohol, methanol or brine, or any engine coolants mixed with alcohol or methanol antifreeze. These can cause engine damage from overheating or freezing.
</li><li>Do not mix with recycled coolant unless it meets the requirements of Ford specification WSS-M97B51-A1. Not all coolant recycling processes meet this Ford specification. Use of such coolant may harm the engine and cooling system components.
</li></ul></b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The addition of Cooling System Stop Leak Pellets VC-6, darkens Motorcraft Premium Gold Engine Coolant from yellow to golden tan.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Fill the radiator through the degas bottle until the coolant level is between the "COOLANT FILL LEVEL" marks.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>On the electronic manual temperature control (EMTC), move the temperature blend selector to the FULL WARM position. On the electronic automatic temperature control (EATC), set the temperature to 32&#176;C (90&#176;F).
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Run the engine at idle until it reaches normal operating temperature.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Add the correct coolant mixture to the degas bottle until the coolant level is at the upper "COOLANT FILL LEVEL" mark.

<ul type="disc"><li>Hot air should discharge from the A/C vents. The engine coolant temperature gauge should maintain a stabilized reading in the middle of the NORMAL range and the upper radiator hose should feel hot to the touch.
