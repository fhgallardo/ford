<p><b>Refrigerant System Recovery
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Ford Motor Company recommends use of an A/C service center to carry out recovery, evacuation and charging of the refrigerant system. If an A/C service center is not available, refrigerant system recovery, evacuation and charging may be
accomplished using a separate recovery station, vacuum pump, charging meter and manifold gauge set.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Leaks in refrigerant system service equipment, hoses or gauges can cause a leak in vacuum that may be misinterpreted as a problem with the vehicle's refrigerant system. It is necessary to leak-test all refrigerant system service equipment,
hoses and gauges on a weekly basis to verify that no leaks are present.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Prior to recovering, you must verify the purity of the refrigerant. For additional information, refer to 
<a href="s62c0014.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Refrigerant Identification Testing
</a> in this section.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Connect an R-134a refrigerant service center to the low- and high-pressure service gauge port valves following the operating instructions provided by the equipment manufacturer.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Recover the refrigerant from the system following the operating instructions provided by the equipment manufacturer.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Once the refrigerant service center has recovered the refrigerant, switch OFF the power supply.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Allow the system to set for about 2 minutes, and observe the system vacuum reading. If the vacuum is not lost, disconnect the recovery equipment.
</li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li>If the system does lose vacuum, repeat Steps 3 through 5 until the vacuum level remains stable for 2 minutes.
</li></ol>

<ol start="7"><li>Carry out the required repairs.

<ol start="1"><li>Connect an R-134a service center to the low- and high-pressure service gauge port valves following the operating instructions provided by the equipment manufacturer.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Evacuate the system until the low-pressure gauge reads at least 99.4 kPa (29.5 in-Hg) of vacuum and as close to 101.1 kPa (30 in-Hg) as possible. Continue to operate the vacuum pump for a minimum of 45 minutes.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Turn OFF the vacuum pump. Observe the low-pressure gauge for 5 minutes to make sure that the system vacuum is held. If vacuum is not held for 5 minutes, leak test the system, repair the leak and evacuate the system again.

<ol start="1"><li>Connect the R-134a manifold gauge set to the low-side and high-side service gauge port valves.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Connect the center (yellow) hose from the manifold gauge set to the suction port on the vacuum pump.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Open all valves on the R-134a manifold gauge set and both service gauge port valves.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Turn on the vacuum pump and evacuate the system until the low-pressure gauge reads at least 99.4 kPa (29.5 in-Hg) of vacuum and as close to 101.1 kPa (30 in-Hg) as possible. Continue to operate the vacuum pump for a minimum of 45 minutes.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Close the high-side and low-side valves on the manifold gauge set (not the service gauge port valves) and turn OFF the vacuum pump.
</li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li>Observe the low-pressure gauge for 5 minutes to make sure that the system vacuum is held. If vacuum is not held for 5 minutes, leak test the system, repair the leak and evacuate the system again.
