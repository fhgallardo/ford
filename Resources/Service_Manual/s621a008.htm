A diagnostic tool is used to trigger the active
command to carry out rezeroing of the OCS system.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  OCS system components (seat wiring harness, seat cushion frame, seat cushion foam pad, bladder with pressure sensor and electronic control unit [ECU]) are calibrated to each other and are serviced as an assembly. 
<b>OCS system
components are not to be installed separately.
</b> If a new OCS system, OCS system component or seat cushion foam pad are needed, a new OCS system service kit (seat cushion frame, seat cushion foam pad, bladder with pressure sensor, seat wiring
harness and ECU must be installed as an assembly.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  To identify between a production OCS system and a service OCS system (OCS service kit) inspect the ECU electrical connector. A production OCS system allows the disconnect of the ECU electrical connector. A service OCS system (OCS service kit)
has the ECU electrical connector glued to the ECU. It cannot and should not be disconnected or altered.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Repair is made by installing a new part only. If the new part does not correct the condition, install the original part and perform the diagnostic procedure again.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When installing a new OCS service kit, refer to

kept at a temperature within the limits, 0&#176;C to 45&#176;C (32&#176;F to 113&#176;F) for a minimum of 30 minutes.
</li><li>Make sure nothing is present on the passenger seat before rezeroing and nothing is placed on the seat during the rezeroing process.
</li><li>Make sure a minimum 8-second time period has passed after cycling the ignition switch ON before the rezeroing process.
</li></ul></b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  For best results in rezeroing, the OCS system should be at or near room temperature, 10&#176;C to 29&#176;C (50&#176;F to 85&#176;F).
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the first attempt to rezero the OCS system is unsuccessful, a second attempt must be made.

</b>  The ignition switch must be cycled after rezeroing the OCS system.
</p>Rezero the occupant classification sensor.

</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="21"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The ignition switch must be cycled after rezeroing the OCS system.
</p>Cycle the ignition switch from ON to OFF.
</li></ol><p><b>All seats
</b><br>

<ol start="22"><li>Prove out the supplemental restraint system (SRS) as follows:

<br>Turn the ignition key from ON to OFF. Wait 10 seconds, then turn the key back to ON and visually monitor the air bag indicator with the air bag modules installed. The air bag indicator will light continuously for approximately 6 seconds and
then turn OFF. If an air bag supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault is present, the air bag indicator will:

<br>- fail to light.

<br>- remain lit continuously.

<br>- flash.

<br>The flashing might not occur until approximately 30 seconds after the ignition switch has been turned from the OFF to the ON position. This is the time required for the restraints control module (RCM) to complete the testing of the SRS. If the
air bag indicator is inoperative and a SRS fault exists, a chime will sound in a pattern of 5 sets of 5 beeps. If this occurs, the air bag indicator and any SRS fault discovered must be diagnosed and repaired.

<br>Clear all continuous DTCs from the restraints control module using a diagnostic tool.
