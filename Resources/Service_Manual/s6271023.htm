<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Always drive the vehicle in a safe manner according to driving conditions and obey all traffic laws.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The Transmission Drive Cycle Test must be followed exactly. Malfunctions must occur 4 times consecutively for shift error DTC code to be set and 5 times consecutively for continuous TCC code to set.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When carrying out the Transmission Drive Cycle Test, refer to the Solenoid Application Chart for correct solenoid operation.
</p><p>After carrying out the Quick Test, use the Transmission Drive Cycle Test for checking continuous codes.
</p><ol start="1"><li>Record and then erase Quick Test codes.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Warm engine to normal operating temperature.
</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Make sure transmission fluid level is correct.
</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>With transmission in OVERDRIVE, moderately accelerate from stop to 80 km/h (50 mph). This allows the transmission to shift into 4thH gear. Hold speed and throttle open steady for a minimum of 15 seconds.
</li></ol><ol start="5"><li>With transmission in 4th gear and maintaining steady speed and throttle opening, lightly apply and release brake to operate stoplamps. Then hold speed and throttle steady for a minimum of 5 seconds.
</li></ol><ol start="6"><li>Brake to a stop and remain stopped for a minimum of 20 seconds.
</li></ol><ol start="7"><li>Repeat steps 4 through 6 at least 5 times.
</li></ol><ol start="8"><li>Carry out Quick Test and record continuous DTCs.

<ul type="disc"><li>If the DTCs are still present, refer to the Diagnostic Trouble Code Chart. Repair all non transmission DTCs first as they can directly affect the operation of the transmission. Repeat the Quick Test and the Road Test to verify the correction.
Erase the DTCs, carry out the Drive Cycle Test and repeat the Quick Test after completing repair on the DTC.
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>If the continuous test passes and a concern is still present, refer to

</a> in this section, OASIS messages and TSBs for concerns.
</li></ul></li></ol><p><b>After On-Board Diagnostic
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The vehicle wiring harness, PCM and non-transmission sensors may affect transmission operations. Repair these concerns first.
</p><p>After the on-board diagnostic procedures are completed, repair all DTCs.
</p><p>Begin with non-transmission related DTCs, then repair any transmission related DTCs. Use the diagnostic trouble code chart for information on condition and symptoms. This chart will be helpful in referring to the correct manual(s) and aids in
diagnosing internal transmission concerns and external non-transmission inputs. The pinpoint tests are used in diagnosing transmission electrical concerns. Make sure that the vehicle wiring harness and the PCM are diagnosed as well. The
Powertrain Control/Emissions Diagnosis (PC/ED) manual will aid in diagnosing non-transmission electronic components.
</p><p><b>Before Pinpoint Tests
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Prior to entering pinpoint tests, check the PCM wiring harness for tight connections, bent or broken pins, corrosion, loose wires, correct routing, correct seals and their condition. Check the PCM, sensors and actuators for damage. Refer to the
Powertrain Control/Emissions Diagnosis (PC/ED) manual.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If a concern still exists after electrical diagnosis has been carried out, refer to 
<a href="s6271030.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Diagnosis By Symptom
</a> in this section.
</p><p>If DTCs appear while carrying out the on-board diagnostics, refer to the 
<a href="s6271024.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Charts

OASIS messages for transmission concerns.
