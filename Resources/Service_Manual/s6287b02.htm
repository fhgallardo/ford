<p><b>Mechanical Shift
</b></p><p>The Borg-Warner 44-06 manual shift transfer case is a 3-piece aluminium design. The unit transfers engine power from the transmission to the front and rear axles. Under normal driving conditions the unit is in 2-wheel drive high (2H), but when
desired, the operator may shift into 4-wheel drive high (4H) or 4-wheel drive low (4L). The transfer case is shifted manually. The unit is lubricated by a positive displacement fluid pump that channels fluid flow through holes in the rear output
shaft.
</p><p><b>Principles of Operation
</b></p><p>The mechanical shift on the fly (MSOF) system is a manual shift 4WD system that allows the operator to chose between 2 different 4x4 modes as well as 2-wheel drive and neutral. The operator can switch between 2WD and 4H mode at speeds up to 88
km/h (55 mph). To engage or disengage 4L range, the vehicle speed must be less than 5 km/h (3 mph), the brake pedal pressed and the transmission must be in NEUTRAL (or the clutch pedal pressed in manual transmission vehicles).
</p><p>The transfer case is equipped with an electromagnetic clutch which is located inside the case. This clutch is used to synchronize the front driveline. When the manual shift lever is moved, this activates the mode indicator switch, triggering
the 4x4 module (PCM) to energize the electromagnetic clutch. When the transfer case front and rear output shafts are synchronized, the spring-loaded lockup collar mechanically engages the mainshaft hub to the drive sprocket. Finally, the front axle
integrated wheel ends (IWEs) are engaged and the electromagnetic clutch is deactivated.

</b></p><p>The Borg-Warner electronic shift transfer case is a 3-piece aluminium design. The unit transfers engine power from the transmission to the front and rear axles. Under normal driving conditions the unit is in 2-wheel drive high (2H), but when
desired, the operator may shift into 4-wheel drive high (4H) or 4-wheel drive low (4L). The transfer case is shifted electronically. The unit is lubricated by a positive displacement fluid pump that channels fluid flow through holes in the rear
output shaft.

<p><b>Principles of Operation
</b></p><p>The electronic shift on the fly (ESOF) system is an electronic shift system that allows the operator to choose between 2 different 4-wheel drive modes as well as 2-wheel drive. The operator can switch between 2WD and 4H mode at speeds up to 88
km/h (55 mph). To engage or disengage 4L range, the vehicle speed must be less than 5 km/h (3 mph), the brake pedal pressed and the transmission must be in NEUTRAL (or the clutch pedal pressed in manual transmission vehicles).
</p><p>The transfer case is equipped with an electromagnetic clutch which is located inside the case. This clutch is used to synchronize the front driveline. When the mode select switch (MSS) on the instrument panel is turned, the 4x4 module (PCM)
activates the electromagnetic clutch and powers the transfer case shift motor. When the shift motor reaches the desired position, as determined by the contact plate position inputs to the 4x4 module (PCM), power to the shift motor will be removed.
When the transfer case front and rear output shafts are synchronized, the spring-loaded lockup collar mechanically engages the mainshaft hub to the drive sprocket. Finally, the front axle integrated wheel ends (IWEs) are engaged and the
electromagnetic clutch is deactivated.

</li></ul><p><b>1 Speed Torque On Demand (TOD) &#8212; Harley-Davidsonï¿½ Vehicles
</b></p><p>The Borg-Warner 1-speed torque on demand (TOD) transfer case is a 3-piece aluminium design. The unit transfers engine power from the transmission to the front and rear axles. Under normal driving conditions the unit is in all-wheel drive (AWD),
but when desired, the operator may shift into 4-wheel drive high (4H). The transfer case is shifted electronically. The unit is lubricated by a positive displacement fluid pump that channels fluid flow through holes in the rear output shaft.

<p><b>Principles of Operation
</b></p><p>The 1 speed TOD system is an electronic shift system that allows the operator to choose between 2 different modes, AWD or 4H. The operator can switch between AWD and 4H mode at speeds up to 88 km/h (55 mph).
</p><p>The transfer case is equipped with an electromagnetic clutch which is located inside the case. This clutch is used to synchronize the front driveline. When the mode select switch (MSS) on the instrument panel is turned, the 4x4 module (PCM)
activates the electromagnetic clutch. When the transfer case front and rear output shafts are synchronized, the spring-loaded lockup collar mechanically engages the mainshaft hub to the drive sprocket.
