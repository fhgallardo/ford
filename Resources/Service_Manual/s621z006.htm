to areas such as door and rear compartment hem flanges, wheelhouse, quarter outer, floor, cowl, roof and other panel-to-panel attaching points. The following joint sealers are recommended for use depending upon the application:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Brushable Seam Sealer &#8212; A sealer intended to restore the original brushed seam appearance. It is used to seal lap joints in sheet metal that are spot welded (for example, floorpans and cowls).
</li><li>Roof Ditch Sealer &#8212; A self-leveling sealer used for drip rails, roof seams, quarter panels to rear deck and for water leaks.
</li><li>Seam Sealer &#8212; A fast curing, non-sag, paintable, permanently flexible sealer typically used for cosmetic seams, truck bed seams, floor pans and door skin seams.
</li><li>Clear Silicone Rubber &#8212; Used for sealing water leaks, noise concerns, remounting trim and repairing torn weatherstripping.
</li></ul><p>Sealers should remain flexible after curing and must be paintable. Follow the manufacturer's directions for correct application of these materials.
</p><p>Any damage to originally sealed joints should be repaired by resealing. Along with attaching points of new panels, open joints that require bridging of sealer to close a gap should be sealed using a heavy-bodied sealer.
