<p><b>Air Bag Module Second Stage Deployment Check
</b></p><p>Because the driver and passenger front air bags each have 2 deployment stages, it is possible that stage 1 has deployed and the second stage has not.
</p><p>If a front air bag module has deployed, it is 
<b>mandatory
</b> that the front air bag module be remotely deployed using the appropriate air bag disposal procedure.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>For additional information on driver air bag module and/or passenger air bag module remote deployment, refer to

<p><b>Diagnosing Customer Concerns Without Hard DTCs
</b></p><p>If a lamp fault code (LFC) is reported by the customer but is not present when the vehicle comes in for service, follow the Diagnostic Instruction procedures in this section to identify the intermittent DTC.
</p><p>Once the DTC is known, read the Normal Operation section of the pinpoint test for the DTC involved.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Follow the deactivation or depowering procedure as directed in this section.
</li><li>Determine the location of components involved in creating the DTC.
</li><li>Carry out a thorough visual inspection of:

<ul type="square"><li>components.
</li><li>connectors.
</li><li>splices and wiring harnesses.
</li><li>insulation on conductors.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>Refer to the Possible Causes section of the pinpoint test for the DTC involved, which lists the common concerns that relate to the DTC. Concerns are listed according to priority.
</p><div><a name="extract_93">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Diagnosing Customer Concerns with Hard DTCs
</b></p><p>Most supplemental restraint system (SRS) diagnostic procedures will require deactivation and reactivation or depowering and repowering of the system. Deactivation and reactivation requires the disconnection of most SRS components and the
installation of restraint system diagnostic tools. Depowering and repowering requires disconnecting of the battery and removal of the restraints control module (RCM) fuse. This reduces the risk of inadvertent deployment of SRS components while
diagnostic procedures are being carried out.
</p><p>Restraint system diagnostic tools are required for the diagnosis and testing of the SRS. It is not acceptable to short-circuit the air bag module connections with a jumper wire. If a jumper wire is used to short-circuit the air bag module
connections, a lamp fault code (LFC) will be displayed.
</p><p><b>Prove Out Procedure
</b></p><p>Turn the ignition switch from the OFF to the ON position and visually monitor the air bag indicator with all SRS components connected or restraint system diagnostic tools installed. The air bag indicator will light continuously for
approximately 6 seconds and then turn off. If an SRS fault is present, the air bag indicator will:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>fail to light.
</li><li>remain lit continuously.
</li><li>flash.
</li></ul><p>The flashing might not occur until approximately 30 seconds after the ignition switch has been turned from the OFF to the ON position. This is the time required for the restraints control module (RCM) to complete the testing of the SRS. If the
air bag indicator is inoperative and an SRS fault exists, a chime will sound in a pattern of 5 sets of 5 beeps. If this occurs, the air bag indicator will need to be repaired before diagnosis can continue.

<p><b>Glossary
</b></p><p><b>Secondary Air Bag Warning
</b></p><p>The secondary air bag warning is an audible fault format that consists of 5 sets of 5 tone bursts, with each set of 5 tone bursts separated by a 5-second quiet period. One tone burst cycle will consist of 1-second ON and 1-second OFF. This
series of 5 activations is repeated every 30 minutes.
</p><p><b>Air Bag/Pretensioner Restraint System Diagnostic Tools
</b></p><p>Air bag/pretensioner restraint system diagnostic tools are used to simulate the equivalent resistance of an air bag module or safety belt pretensioner during certain diagnostic procedures.
</p><p><b>Disconnect the Component
</b></p><p>Disconnect the component means to disconnect the component vehicle harness connector, not to remove the component. Do not reconnect a disconnected component unless instructed to do so.
