A diagnostic tool is used to trigger the active command to carry out rezeroing of the

</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Occupant classification sensor (OCS) system components (seat wiring harness, seat cushion frame, seat cushion foam pad, bladder with pressure sensor and electronic control unit [ECU]) are calibrated to each other and are serviced as an
assembly. The OCS system components are not to be installed separately. If a new OCS system, OCS system component or seat cushion foam pad are needed, a new OCS system service kit (seat cushion frame, seat cushion foam pad, bladder with pressure
sensor, seat wiring harness and electronic control unit) must be installed as an assembly.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  To identify between a production OCS system and a service OCS system (OCS service kit) inspect the ECU electrical connector. A production OCS system allows the disconnect of the ECU electrical connector. A service OCS system (OCS service kit)
has the ECU electrical connector glued to the ECU. It cannot and should not be disconnected or altered.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If a seat equipped with a SRS component is being serviced, 
<b>the SRS must be depowered.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The air bag warning lamp illuminates when the RCM fuse is removed and the ignition switch is ON. This is normal operation and does not indicate a SRS fault.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The SRS must be fully operational and free of faults before releasing the vehicle to the customer.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Repair is made by installing a new part only. If the new part does not correct the condition, install the original part and carry out the diagnostic procedure again.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Production OCS system shown, OCS service kit similar.

<ul type="square"><li>Make sure the OCS system components are connected and no faults are present.
</li><li>Make sure the OCS system is not at a temperature below 0&#176;C (32&#176;F) or above 45&#176;C (113&#176;F) when initiating the rezeroing process. If the vehicle has been exposed to extreme cold or hot temperatures, the vehicle must be exposed and
kept at a temperature within the limits, 0&#176;C to 45&#176;C (32&#176;F to 113&#176;F) for a minimum of 30 minutes.
</li><li>Make sure nothing is present on the passenger seat before rezeroing and nothing is placed on the seat during the rezeroing process.
</li><li>Make sure a minimum 8-second time period has passed after cycling the ignition switch ON before the rezeroing process.
</li></ul></b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  For best results in rezeroing, the OCS system should be at or near room temperature, 10&#176;C to 29&#176;C (50&#176;F to 85&#176;F).
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the first attempt to rezero the OCS system is unsuccessful, a second attempt must be made.
</p>Rezero the occupant classification sensor.

<ul type="disc"><li>With the front passenger seat empty, use a diagnostic tool to trigger the active command and rezero the occupant classification sensor.

<br></li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="12"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The ignition switch must be cycled after rezeroing the OCS system.
</p>Prove out the supplemental restraint system (SRS) as follows:

<br>Turn the ignition key from ON to OFF. Wait 10 seconds, then turn the key back to ON and visually monitor the air bag indicator with the air bag modules installed. The air bag indicator will light continuously for approximately 6 seconds and
then turn off. If an air bag supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault is present, the air bag indicator will:

<br>- fail to light.

<br>- remain lit continuously.

<br>- flash.

<br>The flashing might not occur until approximately 30 seconds after the ignition switch has been turned from the OFF to the ON position. This is the time required for the restraints control module (RCM) to complete the testing of the SRS. If the
air bag indicator is inoperative and a SRS fault exists, a chime will sound in a pattern of 5 sets of 5 beeps. If this occurs, the air bag indicator and any SRS fault discovered must be diagnosed and repaired.

<br>Clear all continuous DTCs from the restraints control module using a diagnostic tool.

<ol start="13"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  A prepaid return postcard is provided with a new OCS service kit. The serial number for the new part and the vehicle identification number (VIN) must be recorded and sent to Ford Motor Company.
</p>When installing a new OCS service kit, fill out the necessary information on the OCS service kit traceability card and return it along with the complete inoperative OCS system to Ford Motor Company.
