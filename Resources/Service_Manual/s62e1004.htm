Therefore, do not allow flames, sparks or lighted substances to come near the battery. When charging or working near a battery, always shield your face and protect your eyes. Always provide
ventilation. Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal injury.

striking components near the front or side air bag sensors, such as doors, instrument panel, console, door latches, strikers, seats and hood latches. Failure to follow these procedures may result in personal injury.

<br><br>Refer to the appropriate vehicle shop manual to determine location of the front air bag sensors.

<br><br>To deplete the backup power supply energy, disconnect the battery ground cable and wait at least 1 minute. Be sure to disconnect auxiliary batteries and power supplies (if equipped). Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal
injury.

Lift with a battery carrier or with your hands on opposite corners. Failure to follow these instructions
may result in personal injury.

Batteries contain sulfuric acid. Avoid contact with skin, eyes or clothing. Also, shield your eyes when working near the battery to protect against possible splashing of the acid solution. In case of acid
contact with the skin or eyes, flush immediately with water for a minimum of 15 minutes and get prompt medical attention. If acid is swallowed, call a physician immediately. Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal injury.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When the battery (or powertrain control module [PCM]) is disconnected and connected, some abnormal drive symptoms may occur while the vehicle relearns its adaptive strategy. The charging system setpoint may also vary. The vehicle may need
to be driven to relearn its strategy.
