</h4><meta name="tps_proctitle" content="Steering Column">

<p>The steering column is the mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and the steering gear. It houses the steering column switches and is able to tilt to various positions for driver preference. The steering wheel is bolted to the main
shaft that runs down the center of the column, connecting to the steering column intermediate shaft. The steering column intermediate shaft goes through the dash panel and connects to the steering gear. The steering column shaft connections are made
by U-joint type couplings. The steering column shaft is centered by roller ball bearings, which are contained within the steering column. The tilt steering column is controlled by a mechanical lever on the underside of the steering column which uses
a cam to lock and unlock the steering column. When the tilt column is unlocked it allows the steering column to adjust up or down using a pin-type pivot in the steering column. The steering column switches (multi-function and ignition) are mounted
to the steering column. These switches are covered by the upper and lower steering column shrouds and can be accessed by removing the shrouds.
