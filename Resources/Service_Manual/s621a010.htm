</li><li>Make sure a minimum 8-second time period has passed after cycling the ignition switch ON before carrying out the OCS system reset process.
</li></ul></b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  For best results, the OCS system should be at or near room temperature, 10&#176;C to 29&#176;C (50&#176;F to 85&#176;F).
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the first attempt to carry out the OCS system reset is unsuccessful, a second attempt must be made.

</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="17"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The ignition switch must be cycled after carrying out the OCS system reset.
</p>Cycle the ignition switch from ON to OFF.
</li></ol><p><b>All seats
</b><br>

<ol start="18"><li>Prove out the supplemental restraint system (SRS) as follows:

<br>Turn the ignition key from ON to OFF. Wait 10 seconds, then turn the key back to ON and visually monitor the air bag indicator with the air bag modules installed. The air bag indicator will light continuously for approximately 6 seconds and
then turn OFF. If an air bag supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault is present, the air bag indicator will:

<br>- fail to light.

<br>- remain lit continuously.

<br>- flash.

<br>The flashing might not occur until approximately 30 seconds after the ignition switch has been turned from the OFF to the ON position. This is the time required for the restraints control module (RCM) to complete the testing of the SRS. If the
air bag indicator is inoperative and a SRS fault exists, a chime will sound in a pattern of 5 sets of 5 beeps. If this occurs, the air bag indicator and any SRS fault discovered must be diagnosed and repaired.

<br>Clear all continuous DTCs from the restraints control module using a scan tool.
