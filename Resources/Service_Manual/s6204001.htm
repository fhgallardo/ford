</h4><meta name="tps_proctitle" content="Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)">

<p>Noise is any undesirable sound, usually unpleasant in nature. Vibration is any motion, shaking or trembling, that can be felt or seen when an object moves back and forth or up and down. Harshness is a ride quality issue where the vehicle's
response to the road transmits sharply to the customer. Harshness normally describes a firmer than usual response from the suspension system. Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) is a term used to describe these conditions, which result in varying
degrees of dissatisfaction. Although, a certain level of NVH caused by road and environmental conditions is normal. This section is designed to aid in the diagnosis, testing and repair of NVH concerns.

</a></div>

<p><b>Acceptable Noise, Vibration and Harshness
</b></p><p>All internal combustion engines and drivelines produce some noise and vibration; operating in a real world environment adds noise that is not subject to control. Vibration isolators, mufflers and dampers reduce these to acceptable levels. A
driver who is unfamiliar with a vehicle can think that some sounds are abnormal when actually the sounds are normal for the vehicle type. For example, Traction-Lok&#174; differentials produce a slight noise on slow turns after extended highway
driving. This is acceptable and has no detrimental effect on the locking axle function. As a technician, it is very important to be familiar with vehicle features and know how they relate to NVH concerns and their diagnosis. For example, if the
vehicle has automatic overdrive, it is important to test drive the vehicle both in and out of overdrive mode.

<p><b>Diagnostic Theory
</b></p><p>The shortest route to an accurate diagnosis results from:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>system knowledge, including comparison with a known good system.
</li><li>system history, including repair history and usage patterns.
</li><li>condition history, especially any relationship to repairs or sudden change.
</li><li>knowledge of possible sources.
</li><li>using a systematic diagnostic method that divides the system into related areas.
</li></ul><p>The diagnosis and correction of noise, vibration and harshness concerns requires:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>a road or system test to determine the exact nature of the concern.
</li><li>an analysis of the possible causes.
</li><li>testing to verify the cause.
</li><li>repairing any concerns found.
</li><li>a road test or system test to make sure the concern has been corrected or brought back to within an acceptable range.

<p><b>Tools and Techniques
</b></p><h5>Vibration Analyzer (EVA)
</h5><p>The vibration analyzer (EVA) is a hand-held electronic scan tool which will assist in locating the source of unacceptable vibrations. The vibration sensor can be remotely mounted anywhere in the vehicle for testing purposes. The unit displays
the 3 most common vibration frequencies and their corresponding amplitudes simultaneously. A bar graph provides a visual reference of the relative signal strength (amplitude) of each vibration being displayed and its relative G force. The keypad is
arranged to make the EVA simple to program and use. Some of the functions include the ability to average readings as well as record, play back and freeze readings. The EVA has a strobe balancing function that can be used to detect imbalance on
rotating components such as a driveshaft or engine accessories.

</p><ol type="a"><li>Test drive the vehicle with the vibration sensor inside the vehicle.
</li><li>Place the sensor in the vehicle according to feel.

<ul type="square"><li>If the condition is felt through the steering wheel, the source is most likely in the front of the vehicle.
</li><li>A vibration that is felt in the seat or floor only will most likely be found in the driveline, drive axle or rear wheels and tires.
</li></ul></li><li>Record the readings. Also note when the condition begins, when it reaches maximum intensity and if it tends to diminish above/below a certain speed.

<ul type="square"><li>Frequencies should be read in the "average" mode.
</li><li>Frequencies have a range of plus or minus 2. A reading of 10 Hz can be displayed as an 8 Hz through 12 Hz.
</li><li>Frequencies with a reading of 0.06 Gs or less, are barely perceptible NVH levels. No corrective action is necessary.
</li></ul></li><li>Place the vibration sensor on or near the suspect area outside the vehicle.
</li><li>Continue the road test, driving the vehicle at the speed the symptom occurs, and take another reading.
</li><li>Compare the readings.

<ul type="square"><li>A match in frequency indicates the problem component or area.
</li><li>Example: A vibration is felt in the seat. Place the sensor on the console. Record the readings. Place the vibration sensor on the rear axle. Compare the readings. If the frequencies are the same, the axle is the problem component.
</li><li>If the 2 readings are not the same frequency, then diagnose the frequency with the most significant amplitude (Gs) first.
</li></ul></li></ol><h5>NVH Analyzer (Vetronix)
</h5><p>The MTS 4000 and the MTS 4100 NVH analyzers are tools to aid in the identification and isolation of a noise, vibration or harshness concern in a vehicle. They measures noise and vibration data and compare it with data obtained from the
vehicle&#39;s powertrain control module (PCM) in order to provide possible sources. The MTS 4000 and the 4100 have the following characteristics:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Interfaces with the vehicle&#39;s computer system
</li><li>Support and store vibration data input from 1 or 2 accelerometers
</li><li>Support and store noise data input from 2 microphones
</li><li>Provide a photo-tachometer for operation of the driveshaft balancing function
</li><li>Provide a strobe output capable of driving a standard timing light
</li><li>Contain a real time clock circuit that provides time and date information which is used for tagging test data
</li><li>Have the capability to print to an external printer and interface with a PC
</li><li>Can be powered from a variety of power sources: cigarette lighter, AC power or the internal battery pack
</li></ul><p>The MTS 4000 and the 4100 NVH analyzers have 4 main operating modes. The first is for vibration diagnosis. This mode measures data from 1 or 2 accelerometers simultaneously while obtaining data from the vehicle&#39;s computer system about the
operation of the vehicle. Then it does a frequency analysis on the accelerometer information and compares the vibration frequencies with the frequencies associated with various rotating components within the vehicle. The data can be presented in 4
different display modes: principle component, bar chart, frequency spectrum or waterfall. All display mode formats contain the same common elements, such as amplitude.
</p><p>The second is for noise diagnosis. This mode measures noise from 1 or 2 microphones simultaneously. All noise measurements are in db&#39;s. All frequency bands used for noise measurements are the same as for the vibration measurements, up to
1000 Hz.
</p><p>The third is driveshaft balancing. Driveshaft balancing is done using 1 or 2 accelerometers and a photo-tachometer. The accelerometers measure the vibrations at both ends of the driveshaft, while the photo-tachometer measures the rotation speed
and position reference.
</p><p>The fourth mode is the strobe. A strobe or standard timing light can be connected to an analyzer, to provide a means for measuring rotational speed. The strobe function is used for isolating the source of a vibration.
</p><h5>Vibrate Software&#174; 
</h5><p>Vibrate Software&#174; (Rotunda tool number 215-00003) is a diagnostic aid which will assist in pinpointing the source of unacceptable vibrations. The engine's crankshaft is the point of reference for vibration diagnosis. Every rotating
component will have an angular velocity that is faster, slower or the same as the engine's crankshaft. Vibrate Software&#174; calculates the angular velocity of each component and graphically represents these velocities on a computer screen and
on a printed vibration worksheet. The following steps outline how Vibrate Software&#174; helps diagnose a vibration concern:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Enter the vehicle information. Vibrate will do all the calculations and display a graph showing tire, driveshaft and engine vibrations.
</li><li>Print a Vibration Worksheet graph. The printed graph is to be used during the road test.
</li><li>Road test the vehicle at the speed where the vibration is most noticeable. Record the vibration frequency (rpm) and the engine rpm on the worksheet graph. The point on the graph where the vibration frequency (rpm) reading and the engine rpm
reading intersect indicates the specific component group causing the concern.

<ul type="square"><li>A EVA or equivalent tool capable of measuring vibration frequency and engine rpm will be needed.
</li></ul></li><li>Provide pictures of diagnostic procedures to aid in testing components.

</h5><p>An electronic listening device used to quickly identify noise and the location under the chassis while the vehicle is being road tested. The ChassisEARs can identify the noise and location of damaged/worn wheel bearings, CV joints, brakes,
springs, axle bearings or driveshaft carrier bearings.
</p><h5>EngineEAR Basic Unit
</h5><p>An electronic listening device used to detect even the faintest noises, the EngineEARs can detect the noise of damaged/worn bearings in generators, coolant pumps, A/C compressors and power steering pumps. They are also used to identify noisy
lifters, exhaust manifold leaks, chipped gear teeth and for detecting wind noise. The EngineEAR has a sensing tip, amplifier and headphones. The directional sensing tip is used to listen to the various components. Point the sensing tip at the
suspect component and adjust the volume with the amplifier. Placing the tip in direct contact with a component will reveal structure-borne noise and vibrations, generated by or passing through, the component. Various volume levels can reveal
different sounds.
</p><h5>Ultrasonic Leak Detector
</h5><p>The Ultrasonic Leak Detector is used to detect wind noises caused by leaks and gaps in areas where there is weatherstripping or other sealing material. It is also used to identify A/C leaks, vacuum leaks and evaporative emission noises. The
Ultrasonic Leak Detector includes a multi-directional transmitter (operating in the ultrasonic range) and a hand-held detector. The transmitter is placed inside the vehicle. On the outside of the vehicle, the hand-held detector is used to sweep the
area of the suspected leak. As the source of the leak is approached, a beeping sound is produced which increases in both speed and frequency.
</p><h5>Squeak and Rattle Repair Kit
</h5><p>The Squeak and Rattle Repair Kit (Rotunda tool number 164-R4900) contains lubricants and self-adhesive materials that can be used to eliminate interior and exterior squeaks and rattles. The kit consists of the following materials:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>PVC (soft foam) tape
</li><li>Urethane (hard foam) tape
</li><li>Flocked (black fuzzy) tape
</li><li>UHMW (frosted) tape
</li><li>Squeak and rattle oil tube
</li><li>Squeak and rattle grease tube
</li></ul><h5>Tracing Powder
</h5><p>Tracing powder is used to check both the uniformity of contact and the tension of a seal against its sealing surface. These tests are usually done when a suspected air leak/noise appears to originate from the seal area or during the alignment
and adjustment of a component to a weatherstrip. Tracing powder can be ordered from Crest Industries as ATR Leak Trace. Carry out the tracing powder test as follows:

</li><li>Spray the tracing powder on the mating surface only.
</li><li>Close the door completely. Do not slam the door.
</li><li>Open the door. An imprint is made where the weatherstrip contacted the mating surface seal. Gaps or a faint imprint will show where there is poor contact with the weatherstrip.

</h5><p>Place an index card or a piece of paper between the weatherstrip and the sealing surface, then close the door. Slowly withdraw the index card or paper after the door is closed and check the amount of pressure on the weatherstrip. There should
be a medium amount of resistance as it is withdrawn. Continue around the entire seal area. If there is little or no resistance, this indicates insufficient contact to form a good seal. At these points, the door, the glass or the weatherstrip is out
of alignment.
