<p><b>Functional Test &#8212; Buckle and Tongue
</b></p><p>The safety belt buckle and tongue assembly must operate freely during the latching and unlatching function. Fasten the safety belt by inserting the tongue (male portion) into the buckle (female portion).
</p><ol start="1"><li>Verify the following during the latching sequence:

<ul type="disc"><li>Tongue insertion is not hindered by excessive effort
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>A "click" is heard when the buckle latches the tongue
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Verify the system integrity by forcefully pulling on the belt webbing.
</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Unlatch the belt by fully depressing the buckle release button, and allowing the belt to release and retract.
</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>Verify the following during the unlatching process:

<ul type="disc"><li>Push-button depression does not require excessive effort
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>Tongue can be removed easily from the buckle
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>Repeat the above steps 3 times
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="5"><li>If the inspection reveals an obvious concern(s) that can be readily identified, service as required. Do not attempt to carry out any repair on the buckle and tongue assembly. If a concern exists with either component, a new safety belt buckle
and safety belt retractor assembly must be installed.
</li></ol><div><a name="extract_76">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Functional Test &#8212; Retractor
</b></p><p>The safety belt retractor assembly must be freely operational for extraction and retraction of the safety belt webbing between FULL EXTENSION and in-vehicle STOWED positions.
</p><ol start="1"><li>Extract and retract the safety belt between the FULL EXTENSION and STOWED positions.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Verify the retractor operates without excessive effort or binding.
</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Install a new safety belt retractor and buckle if no obvious concerns are noticed and the complaint has been verified.
