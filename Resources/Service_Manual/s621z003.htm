</h4><meta name="tps_proctitle" content="Welding Precautions &#8212; Magnesium Alloy">

<p>The radiator support is made of a magnesium alloy. Some of the benefits of using this material are:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Magnesium is lighter and stronger than steel
</li><li>Offers improved durability
</li><li>Improved noise and vibration dampening
</li><li>Improved corrosion resistance
</li><li>100% recyclable
</li></ul><p>The use of this material for the radiator support result in some unique repair characteristics and special precautions are required.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Magnesium is flammable if the entire component is heated above 427&#176;C (800&#176;F).
</li><li>Dust created from sanding or grinding magnesium is highly flammable. Do not smoke or carry an open flame near magnesium dust.
</li><li>When replacing the radiator support, the new support comes as an assembly with the bridging brackets already riveted to the new support. When removing the existing radiator support assembly, remove by cutting the factory spot welds on the
bridging brackets. Do not cut or drill out the bridging brackets at the riveted locations.
</li><li>If any component is bent less than 90 degrees, the part can be straightened. If any cracks occur during the straightening process, the component must be replaced.
</li><li>Magnesium fires can only be extinguished with a type D fire extinguisher.
</li><li>Do not attempt to use water to extinguish magnesium flames. Water will excite the flame.
</li><li>Always wear a Tyvek&#174; suit or similar protective clothing when sanding magnesium parts.
</li><li>Do not attempt to repair cracks. If the component is cracked, it must be replaced.
</li><li>Do not grind on the magnesium casting.
</li><li>Avoid sanding through the powder coating and into the magnesium casting. Light sanding of the powder coating is permissible if required.
</li><li>Corrosion protection needs to be restored whenever it is necessary to sand or grind through painted surfaces or E-coat, or when bare metal repairs are carried out. Refer to
