If certain components of the system are removed, some of the refrigerant oil will go with the component.
To maintain the original total oil charge, it is necessary to compensate for the oil lost by adding oil to the system with the new part.

<br></li></ol><p><b>Refrigerant Oil Adding for New A/C Compressor Installation
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Service A/C compressors are shipped without refrigerant oil.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Rotate the old A/C compressor shaft 8 to 10 full rotations (clockwise) while collecting the refrigerant oil in a clean measuring cup.

</b></p>

<ol start="1"><li>Drill one 12.7 mm (1/2 in) hole in the old suction accumulator or receiver/drier cylinder and drain the oil into a clean measuring cup.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Add the quantity of oil drained, plus the amount collected during refrigerant recovery and 60 ml (2 fl oz).
</li></ol><p><b>Oil Injection Using a Dye/Lubricant Injector
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If fluorescent leak detection dye is also to be added during A/C charging, the dye may be added to the dye/lubricant injector along with the refrigerant oil.
