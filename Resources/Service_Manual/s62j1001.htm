<p><b>Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS)
</b></p><p>The PATS uses radio frequency identification technology to deter a driveaway theft. Passive means that it does not require any activity from the user.
</p><p>The PATS uses a specially encoded ignition key. Each encoded ignition key contains a permanently installed electronic device called a transponder. Each transponder contains a unique electronic identification code, with over 72 million billion
combinations.
</p><p>Each encoded ignition key must be programmed into the vehicle powertrain control module (PCM) before it can be used to start the engine. There are special diagnostic procedures that must be carried out if new encoded ignition keys are to be
configured. Refer to General Procedures in this section.
</p><p>The encoded key is larger than a traditional ignition key. The key does not require batteries and should last the life of the vehicle.
</p><p>The transceiver module communicates with the encoded ignition key. This module is located behind the steering column shroud and contains an antenna connected to a small electronic module. During each vehicle start sequence, the transceiver
module reads the encoded ignition key identification code and sends the data to the PCM.
</p><p>The control functions are contained in the PCM. This module carries out all of the PATS functions such as receiving the identification code from the encoded ignition key and controlling engine enable. The PCM initiates the key interrogation
sequence when the key is turned to ON or START.
</p><p>The PATS function uses the PCM to enable or disable the engine. All elements of PATS must be functional before the engine is allowed to start. If any of the components are not working correctly, the vehicle does not start.
</p><p>PATS uses a visual theft indicator located on top of the instrument panel. This indicator proves out for 3 seconds when the key is turned to ON or START under normal operation. If there is a PATS problem, this indicator either flashes rapidly
or glows steadily (for more than 3 seconds) when the key is turned to ON or START. PATS also "flashes" the theft indicator every 2 seconds at ignition OFF to act as a visual theft deterrent.
</p><p>The PATS is not compatible with aftermarket remote start systems, which allow the vehicle to be started from outside the vehicle. These systems may reduce the vehicle security level, and also may cause no-start issues. Remote start systems must
be removed before investigation of PATS-related no-start issues.
