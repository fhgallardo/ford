<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the first layer of the heated rear window grid (brown) is damaged or missing, it is necessary to apply touch up paint on the glass prior to applying the silver rear window defroster repair.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The grid line material is not embedded into the glass but is baked to the glass surface and consequently can be scraped off. Inoperative lines may appear to the eye to be undamaged due to residue remaining on the glass and will require
diagnosis with a voltmeter or 12V test lamp. For additional information, refer to Diagnosis and Testing in the section.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  An undamaged grid line will have small ridges that project above the surface of the glass and can easily be felt when running a fingernail across them. Grid lines that have been "razor bladed" will feel smooth when a fingernail is dragged
across the affected area. There may be some residue left on the glass that appears to be grid material but a check with a voltmeter or 12V test lamp will confirm an open circuit.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the brown color under the grid line is damaged or missing (this is very rare), it will be necessary to apply lacquer touch-up paint for color match. This paint must meet specification and should be applied to the glass prior to applying the
rear window defroster repair compound.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The interior side of the grid lines are not painted, but due to the silver tarnishing will tend to change the grid to a gold or brown color. The repair area will be bright silver and will also tarnish over time to match the rest of the grid.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Bring the vehicle up to room temperature of at least 16&#176;C (60&#176;F) or above.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Do not use scrapers, sharp instruments or abrasive window cleaners on the interior surface of the rear window glass as this may cause damage to the grid lines.
</p>Clean the entire grid line repair area with window cleaner and 0000 steel wool to remove all dirt, wax, grease, oil or other foreign material.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Mark the location of the grid break on the exterior of the rear window glass.

<ol start="4"><li>Using a polypropylene film fine line tape, mask the area directly above and below the grid break extending the tape 26 mm (1.02 in) beyond the concern area in both directions. The break area should be at the center of the mask.
</li></ol><ul><IMG src="a0047581.gif"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        height="174" width="269" border="1"></ul>


<ol start="5"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the brown layer is not broken or missing, apply only the silver grid repair compound to the break.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If both the brown and silver layers of the grid are broken or missing, apply a coating of the lacquer touch up paint across the break in the grid line first. Do not overlap the silver grid line with the paint. Several applications may be
necessary to achieve a color match.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Extend the silver repair coating at least 6.35 mm (0.25 in) on both sides of the break area.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Allow at least 5 minutes of drying time between applications for the touch up paint or the silver repair coating. Applying fewer coats or not allowing adequate drying time between coats will produce repaired resistance that is greater than OEM
resistance, resulting in poor defrost performance and excessive localized heating.
</p>Apply the repair coating to the grid break area in several smooth, continuous strokes.

<br>Apply a minimum of 6 applications of the grid repair compound.

<ol start="6"><li>After 5 minutes, or after the repair area has dried completely, remove the mask.
</li></ol>

If this occurs, additional repair may be necessary.

<ol start="8"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The repair coating air-dries in approximately one minute and can be energized after 5 minutes.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Optimum adhesion occurs after approximately 24 hours.
