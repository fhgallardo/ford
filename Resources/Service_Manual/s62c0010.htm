Failure to do so puts the shop's bulk refrigerant at risk of contamination. If the vehicle's A/C refrigerant is contaminated, refer the customer to
the service facility that carried out the last A/C service. If the customer wishes to pay the additional cost, use the A/C recovery equipment that is designated for recovering contaminated A/C refrigerant. All contaminated A/C refrigerant must be
disposed of as hazardous waste. For all equipment, follow the equipment manufacturer procedures and instructions.

Internal plumbing of these devices makes it impossible to correctly
remove any residual-flushing agent. These components are typically discarded after A/C system contamination. Hoses without mufflers can normally be reused unless they are clogged with foreign material. The 3.785 liters (1 gallon) of A/C System
Flushing Solvent YN-23 and FL1-A filter used in A/C Flush and Purge Machine 219-00022 are intended for use on one vehicle only. They may be used to flush both the A/C condenser core and the A/C evaporator core on an individual vehicle, but under no
circumstances should they be used on more than one vehicle.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Prior to using the A/C Flush and Purge Machine 219-00022 for the first time, review the operating instructions.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Only the A/C Flush and Purge Machine kit 219-00023, which includes A/C Flush and Purge Machine 219-00022, A/C Flush and Purge Fitting Kit 219-00024 and A/C Systems Flushing Solvent, is approved for use on Ford vehicles. No other flushing device
or solvent is approved for flushing heat exchangers (A/C condenser, A/C evaporator). Use of any other flusher or solvent may cause damage to the A/C system and the flushing unit.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Ford Motor Company has approved a procedure to provide technicians with a non-CFC method of flushing contaminated A/C system heat exchangers. The procedure allows the specific components to be cleaned and flushed while installed in their normal
in-vehicle location. The types of contamination flushed include particle matter that results from A/C compressor or desiccant failure and gummy residue that can form when refrigerant oil is overheated during A/C compressor seizure. The flushing
process is a 2-step procedure that involves the use of an A/C Flush and Purge Machine 219-00022 to:

<ul type="disc"><li>circulate the flushing solvent through the heat exchanger in the reverse direction of normal refrigerant flow (back-flushing). Particulate matter picked up during flushing is filtered from the returning solvent before the solvent is returned to
the reservoir for continued circulation.
</li><li>remove the flushing solvent from the heat exchanger. In this step of the procedure, pressurized air 621-862 kPa (90-125 psi) is used to push and evaporate any remaining flush solvent from the heat exchanger.

</a> in this section.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Disconnect the refrigerant lines from the heat exchanger(s) to be flushed.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Connect the A/C flush and purge machine fitting kit and the A/C flush and purge machine to the heat exchanger to be flushed. Do not flush through the evaporator core orifice (if equipped), TXV (if equipped) or hoses with mufflers. Internal
plumbing and material make-up of these components make it impossible to correctly remove foreign material or residual flushing solvent.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Use 3.785L (1 gal) of A/C Systems Flushing Solvent to flush the heat exchanger for a minimum of 15 minutes. The flush solvent may be used for one or both heat exchangers in the A/C system. However, the flush solvent is intended for one vehicle
only. The filter used on the flushing unit is also intended for use on one vehicle only.
</p>Flush the heat exchanger for a minimum of 15 minutes.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Apply 621-862 kPa (90-125 psi) pressurized air to the component for a minimum of 30 minutes. The 30-minute purge time is required to force and evaporate all residual solvent from the A/C system component. Failure to successfully remove all
residual solvent within the component can result in system damage when reconnected and operated. Dispose of the used flush solvent and filter in accordance with local, state and federal regulations.
</li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  A/C system filtering as described in this section is optional if system flushing is carried out. However, the filter kit use is recommended after flushing if the A/C system contamination is extensive.
</p>Install a new A/C evaporator core orifice (if equipped) and/or TXV (if equipped) in any vehicle being serviced for an internal A/C compressor or desiccant failure.
</li></ol>

<ol start="7"><li>Install new refrigerant hoses with mufflers if clogged with foreign material.
</li></ol>

<ol start="8"><li>Install a new suction accumulator (if equipped), receiver/drier (if equipped) or receiver/drier cartridge (if equipped) in any vehicle being serviced for an internal A/C compressor or desiccant failure.
</li></ol>

<ol start="9"><li>Reconnect the heat exchanger being serviced.
</li></ol>

<ol start="10"><li>If a new A/C compressor is not to be installed, lubricate the refrigerant system with the correct amount of clean PAG oil. For additional information, refer to 
<a href="s62c0013.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Refrigerant Oil Adding

<ol start="11"><li>If a new A/C compressor is not to be installed, evacuate, leak test and charge the A/C system. For additional information, refer to 
<a href="s62c0011.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Air Conditioning (A/C) System Recovery, Evacuation and Charging
