</b>  When installing a new RCM, always make sure the correct RCM is being installed. If an incorrect RCM is installed, erroneous DTCs will result.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The air bag warning lamp illuminates when the RCM fuse is removed and the ignition switch is ON. This is normal operation and does not indicate a supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The SRS must be fully operational and free of faults before releasing the vehicle to the customer.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Repair is made by installing a new part only. If the new part does not correct the condition, install the original part and carry out the diagnostic procedure again.
