<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  This procedure only works if 2 or more programmed ignition keys are available and it is desired to program an additional key(s). If 2 keys are not available, refer to

</a> in this section.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  PID SPARE_KY must be enabled for this procedure to operate. If this PID is not enabled, follow the security access procedure. Refer to 
<a href="s62j1012.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Anti-Theft Security Access
</a> in this section and select SPARE
KEY PROGRAMMING SWITCH: ENABLED.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the programming procedure is successful, the new key(s) starts the vehicle and the THEFT indicator illuminates for approximately 3 seconds.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the programming procedure is not successful, the new key(s) does not start the vehicle and the THEFT indicator flashes. If the programming procedure is not successful, repeat the key programming procedure from Step 1. If the failure repeats,
refer to Diagnosis and Testing in this section to review the DTCs and carry out the pinpoint tests as necessary.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  A maximum of 8 ignition keys can be programmed to a passive anti-theft system (PATS) equipped vehicle. If more are needed, refer to 
<a href="s62j1011.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Key Programming Switch State Control
</a> in this section.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the steps are not carried out as described, the programming procedure ends.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Ignition keys must have the correct mechanical key cut for the vehicle and must be PATS encoded keys.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the vehicle is in unlimited key mode, this spare programming procedure still functions. Any 2 keys that can start the vehicle may be used to program in an additional unlimited key.

<ol start="1"><li>Insert the first programmed ignition key into the ignition and turn the ignition from OFF to ON (maintain the ignition in ON for 1 second).
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Turn the ignition OFF and remove the first key from the ignition lock cylinder.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Within 10 seconds of turning the ignition OFF, insert the second programmed ignition key into the ignition and turn the ignition from OFF to ON (maintain the ignition in ON for 1 second).
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Turn the ignition OFF and remove the second key from the ignition lock cylinder.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Within 20 seconds of turning the ignition to OFF, insert the unprogrammed ignition key (new key) into the ignition and turn the ignition from OFF to START (attempt to start the vehicle).
</li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li>If it is desired to program an additional key(s), repeat the key programming procedure from the beginning.
