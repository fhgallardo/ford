</a></div>

<p><b>General Maintenance Information
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  This is a generic maintenance schedule for all Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. There may be items listed that do not apply to all vehicles.
</p><p>The Normal Schedule applies to operation of the vehicle under typical, everyday driving conditions. The maintenance frequency in this schedule typifies what the vast majority of vehicles will require. The listed services should be carried out
at specified mileage intervals. There are, however, additional services required that only the noted vehicles require.
</p><p>If the vehicle is operated in one or more of the following special operating conditions, those additional services will be required. The special operating conditions are:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>towing or carrying heavy loads.
</li><li>extensive idling and/or driving at low speeds for long distances.
</li><li>driving in dusty conditions.
</li><li>off-road operation.

</li></ul><p><b>Normal Vehicle Axle Maintenance
</b></p><p>Rear axles and power take-off (PTO) units containing synthetic lubricant and light duty trucks equipped with Ford-design axles are lubricated for life. These lubricants are not to be checked or changed unless service is required, or if a leak
is suspected or the axle assembly has been submerged in water.
</p><p>The axle and PTO fluid should be changed anytime they have been submerged in water. Non-synthetic rear axle lubricants should be replaced every 4,800 km (3,000 miles) or 3 months, whichever occurs first, during extended trailer tow operation
above 21&#176;C (70&#176;F) ambient and wide open throttle for extended periods above 45 mph.
</p><p>The 3,000 mile lube change interval may be waived if the axle was filled with 75W140 synthetic gear lubricant meeting Ford specification WSL-M2C192-A, part number F1TZ-19580-B or equivalent. Add 4 ounces of additive friction modifier
C8AZ-19B546-A (EST-M2C118-A) or equivalent for complete refill of Traction-Lok&#174; rear axles.
</p><p>The axle lubricant should be changed anytime an axle has been submerged in water.

</p><p><b>E and F 450 and 550 Series Axle Maintenance
</b></p><p>Replace rear axle lubricant every 100,000 miles under normal driving conditions on all E and F 450 and 550 series applications. For E and F 450 and 550 series vehicles operated at or near maximum Gross Vehicle Weights, the rear axle lubricant
should be replaced every 50,000 miles.
</p><p>In addition, the 50,000 mile schedule should be observed when the vehicles are operated under the Special Operating Conditions.
</p><p><b>Class A Motorhome
