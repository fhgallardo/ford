<p><b>Fluid Pump
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The transmission uses a gerotor-type design front pump support and gear. The pump provides the volume of fluid needed to charge the torque converter, main control assembly, cooling system and lube system. Pump pressure is regulated by the main
regulator valve. The pump has an internal boost circuit which is more efficient at lower engine speeds.
</p><p><b>Filter
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>All fluid drawn from the transmission pan by the pump passes through the filter. The filter and its accompanying seal are part of the fluid path from the sump (pan) to the fluid pump.
</p><p><b>Main Control
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The main control valve body houses 3 electronic solenoids:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Two shift solenoids
</li><li>One torque converter clutch solenoid (TCC solenoid)
</li></ul><p><b>Accumulators
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The transmission uses 2 accumulators:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>1-2 Accumulator &#8212; The 1-2 accumulator is used to soften the 1-2 shift by absorbing some of the pressure directed to the intermediate clutch. Constant line pressure is applied to the middle section of the 1-2 accumulator piston, opposing
the intermediate clutch pressure, until the pressure is high enough to overcome line pressure. The top of the piston is exhausted to the sump.
</li><li>2-3 Accumulator &#8212; The 2-3 accumulator is used to soften the 2-3 shift by absorbing some of the direct clutch pressure. Forward clutch pressure is applied to the top side of the 2-3 accumulator piston, holding the piston down until clutch
pressure is high enough to overcome it. The middle section of the piston is exhausted to the sump.
