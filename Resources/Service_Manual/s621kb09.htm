<ol start="1"><li>Safety and environmental concerns require consideration and treatment of restraints system deployable and pyrotechnic devices when disposing of vehicles, deployable devices or pyrotechnic devices. Deploying deployable and pyrotechnic devices
before scrapping a vehicle or the device eliminates the potential for hazardous exposures or reactions during processing. If special handling procedures are followed, deployable and pyrotechnic devices can be deployed safely and recycled with the
vehicle, shipped separately to a recycling facility or disposed of safely.

<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  To determine the deployable devices a vehicle is equipped with, refer to the Description and Operation portion of this section.

This will reduce the risk of injury in the event of an accidental deployment.

Due to the loud report which occurs when the deployable steering column is deployed, hearing protection is
required.

<ol start="2"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  It may be necessary to lower or remove the deployable steering column from the instrument panel to access the deployable steering column electrical connector.
</p>Access the deployable steering column electrical connector.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the deployable steering column does not have a hard-wired pigtail, it will be necessary to cut the wires and connector(s) from the vehicle wire harness and reconnect to the deployable steering column.
</p>Cut each of the deployable steering column wires, leaving at least 4 inches to work with.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Remove any sheathing (if present) and strip the insulation from the ends of the cut wires.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Make a jumper harness to deploy the deployable steering column.

<ul type="disc"><li>Obtain 2 wires (20 gauge minimum) at least 9.14 meters (30 feet) long and strip both ends of each wire.
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>At one end of the jumper harness, connect the wires together.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li>Using the end of the jumper harness that the wires are not connected together, attach each wire of the jumper harness to each wire of the deployable steering column. Use tape or other insulating material to make sure that the leads do not make
contact with each other.

<ol start="7"><li>Remain at least 9.14 meters (30 feet) away from the deployable steering column.
</li></ol>

<ol start="8"><li>From the end of the jumper harness that is not connected to the deployable steering column, disconnect the 2 wires of the jumper harness from each other.
</li></ol>

<ol start="9"><li>Deploy the deployable steering column by touching the ends of the 2 wires of the jumper harness to the terminals of a 12-volt battery.
</li></ol>

<ol start="10"><li>To allow for cooling, wait at least 10 minutes before approaching the deployed steering column.
</li></ol>

<ol start="11"><li>Dispose of the deployed steering column in the same manner as any other part to be scrapped.
