Use a suitable torque converter/fluid cooler cleaner.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the vehicle is equipped with a oil-to-air (OTA) cooler, a new OTA must be installed.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Cleaning and backflushing the transmission fluid cooling system along with following all the normal cleaning and inspection procedures in this section during disassembly and reassembly will keep contamination from reentering the transmission
and causing a repeat repair.
</p><p>When internal wear or damage has occurred in the transmission, metal particles, clutch plate material or band material may have been carried into the torque converter and transmission fluid cooler. These contaminants are a major cause of
recurring transmission troubles and must be removed from the system before the transmission is put back into use.
</p><p><b>Transmission Fluid Cooler Flow Test
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The transmission linkage/cable adjustment, fluid level and line pressure must be within specification before carrying out this test. Refer to

</li></ol><ol start="5"><li>Connect one end of a hose to the cooler return line and route other end of the hose up to a point where it can be inserted into the funnel at the fluid filler tube.
</li></ol><ol start="6"><li>Remove the safety stands and lower the vehicle. Insert end of hose into the funnel.
</li></ol><ol start="7"><li>Start the engine and run it at idle with the transmission in NEUTRAL.
</li></ol><ol start="8"><li>When fluid flows from the hose in a steady stream, a liberal amount of fluid should be observed. "Liberal" is about 1 liter (1 quart) delivered in 15 seconds. If a liberal flow is observed, the test is complete.
