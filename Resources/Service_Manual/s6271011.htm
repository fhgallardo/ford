<p>There are 8 apply components used to drive or hold the planetary gearset components.
</p><p><b>Band &#8212; Overdrive
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The overdrive band holds the reverse clutch drum stationary in 4th gear and MANUAL 2. This action causes the reverse sun gear to be held in these ranges.
</p><p><b>Band &#8212; Low and Reverse
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The low and reverse band holds the pinion carrier in REVERSE. The reverse band also applies in MANUAL 1 position to provide engine braking.
</p><p><b>Clutch &#8212; Intermediate
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The intermediate clutch works with the intermediate one-way clutch to hold the reverse sun gear stationary in 2nd gear. The intermediate clutch remains applied in 3rd and 4th gears, but does not transmit power.
</p><p><b>Clutch &#8212; Forward
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The forward clutch couples the forward clutch cylinder and input shaft to the forward sun gear in 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears. The forward clutch is not applied in 4th gear.
</p><p><b>Clutch &#8212; Direct
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The direct clutch couples the input shaft to the planet carrier through the stub shaft in 3rd and 4th gears.
</p><p><b>Clutch &#8212; Reverse
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The reverse clutch couples the input shaft to the reverse sun gear, applied in reverse range only.
</p><p><b>One-Way Clutch &#8212; Planetary (Low)
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The planetary (low) one-way clutch is a roller clutch that holds the planetary gearset in 1st gear, (D) and D ranges. During automatic coasting downshifts into 1st gear ((D) and D ranges), the planetary one-way clutch freewheels so
there is no engine braking.
</p><p><b>One-Way Clutch &#8212; Intermediate
</b></p><p>For component location, refer to 
<a href="s6271063.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Transmission
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The intermediate one-way clutch works with the intermediate friction clutch to hold the reverse clutch drum and reverse sun gear stationary in 2nd gear during acceleration. The intermediate one-way clutch freewheels in 3rd gear and during
coasting in 2nd gear, (D) and D ranges.
