Remove from vehicle prior to road use. Failure to remove could result in injury and possible violation of vehicle safety standards.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  After diagnosing or repairing a supplemental restraint system (SRS), 
<b>the restraint system diagnostic tools (if required) must be removed before operating the vehicle over the road.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  After diagnosing or repairing a seat system, 
<b>the restraint system diagnostic tools (if required) must be removed before operating the vehicle over the road.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Deployable devices (such as air bag modules, pretensioners) may deploy alone or in various combinations depending on the impact event.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Always refer to the appropriate workshop manual procedures prior to carrying out vehicle repairs affecting the supplemental restraint system (SRS) and safety belt system.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The SRS must be fully operational and free of faults before releasing the vehicle to the customer.
</p><p><b>All vehicles
</b><br>

<ol start="1"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Refer to the correct removal and installation procedure for all SRS components being installed.
</p>When any deployable device or combination of devices are deployed and/or the restraints control module (RCM) has the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) B1231 (Crash Data Memory Full) in memory, the repair of the vehicle's SRS is to include the
removal of all deployed devices and the installation of new deployable devices, the removal and installation of new impact sensors, and the removal and installation of a new RCM. DTCs must cleared from all required modules after repairs are carried
out.
</li></ol><p><b>Vehicles with occupant classification sensor (OCS) system 
</b><br>

<ol start="2"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  After installation of new occupant classification sensor (OCS) components carry out the OCS System Reset procedure as instructed in the workshop manual. Refer to the appropriate workshop manual (WSM) for OCS system removal and installation
procedure.
</p>When a vehicle has been involved in a collision and the occupant classification sensor (OCS) module has DTC B1231 stored in memory, the repair of the OCS system is to include the following procedures for the specified system:

<ul type="disc"><li>For rail type OCS system, inspect the passenger side floorpan for damage and repair as necessary. Install new OCS rails.
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>For weight sensor bolt type OCS system, inspect the passenger side floorpan for damage and repair as necessary. Install a new seat track with OCS weight sensor bolts.
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Most bladder type OCS modules do not store a DTC B1231 in memory after deployment. The DTC B1231 is stored only by the RCM.
</p>For bladder type OCS system, inspect for damage and repair as necessary. If installation of an OCS component is required, an OCS service kit must be installed.
</li></ul></li></ol><p><b>All vehicles
</b><br>

<ol start="3"><li>When any damage to the impact sensor mounting points or mounting hardware has occurred, repair or install new mounting points and mounting hardware as needed.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>When the driver air bag module has deployed, a new clockspring must be installed.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>New driver and/or front passenger safety belt systems (including retractors, buckles and height adjusters) must be installed if the vehicle is involved in a collision that results in deployment of the driver and/or front passenger safety belt
pretensioners. For additional information, refer to
