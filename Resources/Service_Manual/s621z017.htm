</b>  Ford Motor Company does not approve or recognize structural repair procedures using anything but genuine Ford parts. Structural repairs (frames, rails, aprons and body panels) carried out using other than Ford Motor Company parts have not been
tested. In addition, structural equivalence and corrosion protection cannot be assured. Returning a vehicle to pre-accident condition can only be assured if repair procedures are carried out by skilled technicians using genuine Ford Motor Company
