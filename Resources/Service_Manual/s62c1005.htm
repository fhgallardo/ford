<p>The A/C refrigerant system is a clutch cycling orifice tube type. The system components are:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A/C compressor
</li><li>A/C condenser core
</li><li>A/C evaporator core
</li><li>Suction accumulator
</li><li>Connecting refrigerant lines
</li></ul><p>The refrigeration system operation is controlled by the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Evaporator core orifice tube.
</li><li>A/C cycling switch.
</li><li>A/C compressor pressure relief valve.
</li><li>A/C high pressure cutoff switch.
</li></ul><p>The refrigerant system incorporates an A/C compressor controlled by the powertrain control module (PCM) through an A/C clutch relay.
</p><p>The A/C cycling switch senses evaporator core pressure to control A/C compressor operation.
</p><p>An evaporator core orifice tube is installed in the condenser-to-evaporator line at the A/C condenser fitting to meter the liquid refrigerant into the evaporator core.
</p><p>The A/C compressor clutch will only be engaged by the PCM if all of the following conditions are met:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>The climate control assembly is set to a mode which provides an A/C request to the instrument cluster. This request is then transferred to the PCM through the CAN bus.
</li><li>The A/C cycling switch is reading an acceptable low side refrigerant pressure.
</li><li>The A/C high pressure cutoff switch is not open due to excessive pressure in the high side of the refrigerant system.
</li><li>The A/C compressor relay is energized by the PCM.
</li><li>The engine coolant temperature is not excessively high.
</li><li>The PCM has not detected a wide open throttle (WOT) condition.
</li></ul><p>An A/C compressor pressure relief valve is installed in the compressor manifold and tube assembly to protect the refrigerant system against excessively high refrigerant pressures.

<p><b>A/C Compressor and Clutch Assembly
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Internal A/C compressor components are not repaired separately. The Visteon FS-10 A/C compressor is repaired only as an assembly. The A/C clutch disc assembly, A/C clutch pulley, A/C clutch field coil and the compressor shaft seal are
repairable.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Installation of a new suction accumulator is not required when repairing the air conditioning system except when there is physical evidence of system contamination from a failed A/C compressor or damage to the suction accumulator.
</p><p>The Visteon FS-10 A/C compressor has the following characteristics:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A 10-cylinder swashplate design utilizing the tangential design mount.
</li><li>A one-piece lip-type seal (installed from the front of the A/C compressor) is used to seal it at the shaft opening in the assembly.
</li><li>Five double-acting pistons operate within the cylinder assembly. The pistons are actuated by a swashplate that changes the rotating action of the shaft to a reciprocating force.
</li><li>Reed-type discharge valves are located between the cylinder assembly and the head at each end of the A/C compressor.
</li><li>The A/C compressor uses PAG oil or equivalent. This oil contains special additives required for the A/C compressor.
</li><li>The A/C compressor oil from vehicles equipped with an FS-10 A/C compressor may have a dark color while maintaining a normal oil viscosity. This is normal for this A/C compressor because carbon from the piston rings will discolor the oil.

<p>The magnetic A/C clutch disc and hub assembly has the following characteristics:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>The A/C clutch drives the compressor shaft.
</li><li>When battery positive voltage (B+) is applied to the A/C clutch field coil, the clutch plate and hub assembly is drawn toward the A/C clutch pulley.
</li><li>The magnetic force locks the clutch disc and hub assembly and the A/C clutch pulley together as one unit, causing the compressor shaft to rotate.
</li><li>When B+ is removed from the A/C clutch field coil, springs in the clutch disc and hub assembly move the clutch plate away from the A/C clutch pulley.
</li></ul><p><b>A/C Compressor Pressure Relief Valve
</b></p><p>An A/C compressor pressure relief valve is incorporated in the compressor manifold and tube assembly to:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>relieve unusually high refrigerant system discharge pressure buildups.
</li><li>prevent damage to the A/C compressor and other system components.
</li><li>avoid total refrigerant loss by closing after the excessive pressure has been relieved.
</li></ul><p><b>Condenser Core
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Installation of a new suction accumulator is not required when repairing the air conditioning system except when there is physical evidence of system contamination from a failed A/C compressor or damage to the suction accumulator.
</p><p>The condenser core has the following characteristics:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>It is an aluminum fin and tube design heat exchanger located in front of the vehicle radiator.
</li><li>It cools compressed refrigerant gas by allowing air to pass over fins and tubes to extract heat and by condensing gas to liquid refrigerant as it is cooled.
</li></ul><p><b>Refrigerant Lines
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Installation of a new suction accumulator is not required when repairing the air conditioning system except when there is physical evidence of system contamination from a failed A/C compressor or damage to the suction accumulator.
</p><p>The compressor manifold and tube assembly is attached to the A/C compressor, is sealed with O-ring seals, and has the following features:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>The upstream side contains low pressure refrigerant gas.
</li><li>The downstream side contains high pressure refrigerant gas and a fitting used to mount a serviceable high-pressure A/C charge port valve.
</li><li>The downstream side also contains a fitting used to mount the A/C high pressure cutoff switch. A long-travel Schrader-type valve stem core is installed in the fitting so that the A/C high pressure cutoff switch can be removed without
discharging the A/C system.
</li></ul><p><b>Evaporator Core
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If an evaporator core leak is suspected, the evaporator core must be vacuum leak tested before it is removed from the vehicle.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Installation of a new suction accumulator is not required when repairing the air conditioning system except when there is physical evidence of system contamination from a failed A/C compressor or damage to the suction accumulator.
</p><p>The evaporator core is the plate/fin type with a unique refrigerant flow path.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A mixture of refrigerant and oil enters the bottom of the evaporator core through the evaporator core inlet tube and then moves out of the evaporator core through the evaporator core outlet tube.
</li><li>Airflow from the blower motor passes through the evaporator core where it is cooled and dehumidified before entering the passenger compartment.
</li></ul><p><b>Evaporator Core Orifice Tube
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  A new evaporator core orifice tube should be installed whenever a new A/C compressor is installed.
</p><p>The A/C evaporator core orifice has the following characteristics:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>It is located in the condenser-to-evaporator line at the condenser fitting.
</li><li>It has filter screens located on the inlet and outlet ends of the tube body.
</li><li>The inlet filter screen acts as a strainer for the liquid refrigerant flowing through the evaporator core orifice tube.
</li><li>O-ring seals on the evaporator core orifice tube prevent the high-pressure liquid refrigerant from bypassing the evaporator core orifice tube.
</li><li>Adjustment or service cannot be carried out to the evaporator core orifice tube. A new evaporator core orifice must be installed.
</li></ul><p><b>Suction Accumulator
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Installation of a new suction accumulator is not required when repairing the air conditioning system except when there is physical evidence of system contamination from a failed A/C compressor or damage to the suction accumulator.
</p><p>The suction accumulator is mounted at the RH rear of the engine compartment. The evaporator outlet line attaches directly to the inlet of the suction accumulator and the compressor manifold and tube assembly attaches to the suction accumulator
outlet.
</p><p>After entering the inlet of the suction accumulator, the heavier oil-laden refrigerant contacts an internally mounted dome (which serves as an umbrella) and drips down onto the bottom of the canister.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A small diameter oil bleed hole, in the bottom of the vapor return tube, allows the accumulated heavier liquid refrigerant and oil mixture to re-enter the compressor suction line at a controlled rate.
</li><li>As the heavier mixture passes through the small diameter liquid bleed hole, it has a second chance to vaporize and recirculate through the A/C compressor without causing compressor damage due to slugging.
</li><li>A fine mesh screened filter fits tightly around the bottom of the vapor return inlet to filter out refrigerant system contaminant particles.
</li><li>A desiccant bag is mounted inside the canister to absorb any moisture which may be in the refrigerant system.
</li></ul><p><b>Air Conditioning (A/C) Cycling Switch
</b></p><p>The A/C cycling switch is mounted on a Schrader valve-type fitting on the suction accumulator.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A valve depressor, located inside the threaded end of the A/C cycling switch, presses in on the Schrader valve stem.
</li><li>This allows the suction pressure to control the operation of the A/C cycling switch.
</li><li>The electrical switch contacts open when the suction pressure drops. The contacts close when the suction pressure rises.
</li><li>When the A/C cycling switch contacts close, the signal to energize the A/C compressor clutch field coil is sent to the PCM.
</li><li>When the A/C cycling switch contacts open, the A/C compressor clutch field coil is de-energized and A/C compressor operation stops via the PCM an A/C clutch relay.
</li><li>The A/C cycling switch will control the evaporator core pressure at a point where the plate/fin surface temperature will be maintained slightly above freezing.
</li><li>This prevents icing of the evaporator core and blockage of airflow.
</li><li>It is not necessary to discharge the refrigerant system to remove the A/C cycling switch.
</li></ul><p><b>High Pressure Cutoff Switch
</b></p><p>The high pressure cutoff switch is used to interrupt A/C compressor operation in the event of high system discharge pressures.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>The high pressure cutoff switch is mounted on a Schrader valve-type fitting on the high pressure side of the compressor manifold and tube assembly.
</li><li>A valve depressor, located inside the threaded end of the high pressure cutoff switch, presses on the Schrader valve stem.
</li><li>This allows the high pressure cutoff switch to monitor the A/C compressor discharge pressure.
</li><li>When the A/C compressor discharge pressure rises, the switch contacts open, disengaging the A/C compressor. When the pressure drops, the contacts close to allow operation of the A/C compressor via the PCM and A/C clutch relay.
</li><li>It is not necessary to discharge the refrigerant system to remove the high pressure cutoff switch.
</li></ul><p><b>Spring Lock Coupling
</b></p><IMG src="n0015650.gif"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        height="174" width="269" border="1"><br><table width="70%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1"><th valign="bottom">Item

<p>When disconnecting or connecting spring lock couplings, observe the following.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>When the coupling is connected together, the flared end of the female fitting slips behind the garter spring inside the cage of the male fitting.
</li><li>The garter spring and cage then prevent the flared end of the female fitting from pulling out of the cage.
</li><li>Three O-ring seals are used to seal between the 2 halves of the couplings.
</li><li>Use only the O-ring seals listed in the Ford Master Parts Catalog for the spring lock coupling.
</li><li>A plastic indicator ring is used to indicate, during vehicle assembly, that the coupling is connected. Once the coupling is connected, the indicator ring is no longer necessary but will remain captive by the coupling near the cage opening.
</li><li>The indicator ring may also be used during service operations to indicate connection of the coupling.
</li><li>An A/C tube lock coupling clip may be used to secure the coupling but is not required.

<p>The fitting is an integral part of the refrigeration line or component.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Special couplings are required for both the high-side and low-side service gauge ports.
</li><li>A very small amount of leakage will always be detectable around the Schrader-type valve with the service gauge port valve cap removed, and is considered normal. A new Schrader-type valve core can be installed if the seal leaks excessively.
</li><li>The service gauge port valve caps are used as primary seals in the refrigerant system to prevent leakage through the Schrader-type valves from reaching the atmosphere. Always install and tighten the A/C service gauge port valve caps to the
correct torque after they are removed.
</li></ul><p><b>Refrigerant System Dye
</b></p><p>Fluorescent refrigerant system dye is added to the refrigerant system at the factory to assist in refrigerant system leak diagnosis using a Rotunda-approved ultraviolet blacklight. It is not necessary to add additional dye to the refrigerant
system before diagnosing leaks, even if a significant amount of refrigerant has been removed from the system. New suction accumulators are shipped with a fluorescent dye "wafer" included in the desiccant bag which will dissolve after approximately
30 minutes of continued A/C operation. It is not necessary to add dye after flushing or filtering the refrigerant system because a new suction accumulator is installed as part of the flushing or filtering procedure. Additional refrigerant system dye
should only be added if more than 50 percent of the refrigerant system lubricant capacity has been lost due to a fitting separation, hose rupture or other damage. Refer to
