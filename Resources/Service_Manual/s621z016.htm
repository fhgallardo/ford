This vehicle is a full frame vehicle which was designed with energy absorbing features in the front frame horns to manage crash energy. This section of the frame
MUST NOT be straightened if any holes or surfaces show evidence of collapse or buckling. If any evidence of damage exists BEHIND the first frame crossmember in terms of buckling, cracking, the ENTIRE FRAME must be replaced.

</b>  Ford Motor Company does not approve or recognize structural repair procedures using anything but genuine Ford parts.

<p>Structural repairs (frames, rails, aprons and body panels) carried out using other than Ford Motor Company parts have not been tested. In addition, structural equivalence and corrosion protection cannot be assured.
</p><p>Returning a vehicle to pre-accident condition can only be assured if repair procedures are carried out by skilled technicians using genuine Ford Motor Company parts and approved methods.
</p><p>Structural component repair procedures approved by Ford using genuine parts have been validated through testing by Ford Motor Company engineers. Should alternative structural component repair procedures and/or parts be used, repairers should be
aware of the potential liability they incur.

<ol start="10"><li>Make sure the repair joint and surrounding repair area have attained a temperature of a minimum 10&#176; C (50&#176; F) before carrying out weld procedure.

<ul type="disc"><li>Lower the body onto the frame and recheck fit and alignment, then raise it.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="12"><li>Weld the joint completely, if fit and alignment are correct, using a metal inert gas (MIG) welding machine capable of producing a minimum of 200 amps. Use 0.9-0.11 mm (0.035-0.045 in) ER70S-3 or equivalent weld wire that is compatible with SAE
1010 steel.
</li></ol>

<ol start="13"><li>Dress weld as necessary.
</li></ol>

<ol start="14"><li>Use a dye penetrant to determine if any cracks or large voids exist in the weld joint. If cracks or other defects exist, grind out the defect and repair until the weld is free of defects.

<ul type="disc"><li>Clean the repair area with metal surface prep and apply anti-corrosion coating to the affected areas of the frame and service replacement section.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="15"><li>Reinstall components removed during disassembly. Make sure all fasteners are tightened to the correct specification.
