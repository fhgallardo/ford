<p><b>Front Disc Brake
</b></p><p>The front brake disc is a vented, full-cast type. The caliper is a double-piston type.
</p><div><a name="extract_205">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Rear Disc Brake
</b></p><p>The rear brake disc is a vented, full-cast, drum-in-hat type. The caliper is a single-piston type. Each brake pad is equipped with a riveted spring clip that secures it to either the brake caliper piston or the brake caliper housing.
</p><div><a name="extract_206">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Parking Brake
</b></p><p>The parking brake system is a mechanical system that activates a shoe-and-drum system within the rear brake disc.
</p><div><a name="extract_207">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Hydraulic Brake Actuation
</b></p><p>The brake pedal is connected to the power brake booster, which is connected to the brake master cylinder. When the brake pedal is pressed, brake fluid is forced from the master cylinder through the metal tubing and flexible hoses to the front
disc brake calipers and the rear disc brake calipers. The front disc brake caliper pistons are forced outward against the brake pads which contact the braking surface of the brake discs. The brake fluid calipers are pressurized by the master
cylinder, forcing the disc brake caliper pistons outward against the brake pads. The brake pads press against the braking surface on the brake discs. When the brake pedal is released, the pressure is relieved, returning the brake caliper pistons and
the brake pads to the at-rest position.
</p><p>The dual brake system is split front and rear with the front wheel brakes comprising one circuit and the rear wheel brakes the other circuit.
</p><div><a name="extract_208">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Adjustable Pedals
</b></p><p>If equipped, the brake and accelerator pedals are adjustable. Using the adjustable pedals switch, located on the instrument panel, the driver can adjust the brake and accelerator pedals for a more comfortable driving position. The adjustable
pedals feature is operational with the ignition switch ON or OFF. For removal and installation of the brake pedals, refer to

accelerator pedal, refer to

<p><b>Adjustable Pedals with Memory
</b></p><p>If equipped, the driver seat module (DSM) controls the memory adjustable pedals.
</p><p>The DSM constantly monitors the systems under its control and reports a concern in the form of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). A DTC can be retrieved with a diagnostic tool through the data link connector (DLC).
</p><div><a name="extract_210">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Memory Adjustable Pedal Operation
</b></p><p>The adjustable pedals with memory feature can be controlled by using the memory switches or the remote keyless entry (RKE) transmitter. The system can store 2 memory settings.
