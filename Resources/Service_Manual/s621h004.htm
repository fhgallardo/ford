</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  A new roof opening panel motor will only OPEN and must be initialized.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The roof opening panel motor initialization procedure must be done when repairs are carried out on any part of the roof opening panel system, including: any time the roof opening panel motor has been removed from the roof opening panel
assembly, a new roof opening panel motor has been installed or when a new roof opening panel assembly has been installed.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Turn the ignition to the RUN position. For a new roof opening panel motor, skip to Step 3.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The roof opening panel glass will travel to the comfort STOP position first, which is approximately 2 inches from the full OPEN position. Press the OPEN switch again to fully open the roof opening panel.
</p><b>For an existing roof opening panel motor,
</b> open the roof opening panel glass to the full OPEN position.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li><b>For a new roof opening panel motor,
</b> hold the open switch until the roof opening panel glass moves to the full OPEN position, then continue to hold the open switch until the roof opening panel glass moves slightly rearward and then
slightly forward to the stored OPEN position.

<br><b>For an existing motor,
</b> press and hold the open switch (for approximately 10 seconds) until the roof opening panel glass moves past full OPEN, then to full OPEN near the rear of the roof opening panel assembly, then quickly release
the switch.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  After pressing and holding the open switch in this step, it will take approximately 3 seconds for the roof opening panel to begin close/tilt/close (initialization) movements.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the switch is released before close/tilt/close (initialization) movements are complete, go back to Step 3.
</p>Press and hold the open switch until after the roof opening panel carries out close/tilt-up/close (initialization) movements.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Release the open switch and test the system for normal operation by carrying out one-touch open to comfort stop, full open, close from full open to comfort stop, close from comfort stop to full close and tilt operation.
