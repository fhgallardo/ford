<p><b>Hydraulic Brake Actuation
</b></p><p>The brake pedal is connected to the power brake booster, which is connected to the brake master cylinder. When the brake pedal is pressed, brake fluid is forced from the master cylinder through the steel tubing and flexible hoses to the front
disc brake calipers and the rear disc brake calipers. The front disc brake caliper pistons are forced outward against the brake pads, which contact the braking surface of the brake discs. The brake fluid calipers are pressurized by the master
cylinder, forcing the disc brake caliper pistons outward against the brake pads. The brake pads press against the braking surface on the brake discs. When the brake pedal is released, the pressure is relieved, returning the brake caliper pistons and
the brake pads to the at-rest position.
</p><p>The dual brake system is split front and rear with the front wheel brakes comprising one circuit and the rear wheel brakes the other circuit.

<p><b>Adjustable Pedals
</b></p><p>If equipped, the brake and accelerator pedals are adjustable. Using the adjustable pedals switch located on the instrument panel, the driver can adjust the brake and accelerator pedals for a more comfortable driving position. For removal and
installation of the brake pedal, refer to

<p><b>Adjustable Pedals with Memory
</b></p><p>If equipped, the driver seat module (DSM) controls the memory adjustable pedals.
</p><p>The DSM constantly monitors the systems under its control and reports a concern in the form of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). A DTC can be retrieved with a scan tool through the data link connector (DLC).
</p><p><b>Adjustable Pedals Integrity
</b></p><p>The integrity of the adjustable pedals and their associated transmissions can be verified by removing the drive cables from the individual adjustable pedal transmission. A firm tug on the cable will allow the cable to be released from the
adjustable pedal transmission. At this time, the adjustable pedals motor can be operated to determine if the concern is due to a jammed adjustable pedal transmission or improperly timed adjustable pedal. Timing the pedals involves installing one
cable into the respective transmission and operating the adjustable pedal switch until the particular pedal involved is bottomed out to the same position as the other pedal.
