<p>The digital versatile disc (DVD) is available with all the radios (Super Crew) except the base AM/FM radio. The DVD player is enabled when the key is in the RUN or ACCESSORY position and audio unit is turned on. The rear speakers are controlled
by the DVD player.
</p><p>Audio signals always pass through the DVD player to the rear speakers. These signals are interrupted and the rear speakers are disabled when the DVD player is placed in dual-play mode. In this mode, the DVD player can play independently of the
audio unit, through headphones, while allowing front passengers to listen to the audio unit through the front speakers. Additionally, while in this mode, some audio unit controls can be accessed through the DVD player. This mode is entered by
pressing the aux button on the audio unit or by pressing the headphone button on the DVD player. Pressing the headphone button on the DVD player exits this mode.
