tether bracket assemblies [if equipped], and attaching hardware) should be inspected after any collision. Ford recommends new safety belt assemblies be installed unless a qualified technician finds the assemblies show no damage and operate
correctly. Safety belt assemblies not in use during a collision should also be inspected and new assemblies installed if either damage or incorrect operation is noted.

<br><br>The automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature of the safety belt retractor must be checked by a qualified technician to verify that the ALR feature for a child seat is functioning correctly, in addition to other checks for correct safety belt
system function. A new belt and retractor assembly must be installed if the safety belt assembly's ALR feature or any other safety belt function is not operating correctly when inspected according to the functional inspection procedures in the
workshop manual. Failure to install a new belt and retractor assembly could increase the risk of injury in collisions.
</b></p><p>When any new active occupant restraint components are installed, use only the replacement parts specified in the Ford Customer Service Division Master Parts Catalog.
</p><p>The active restraint system consists of the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Front row safety belt buckles and pretensioners, attached to the inboard side of the outboard seats
</li><li>Front row safety belt retractors, located behind the lower B-pillar trim panels (vehicles without seat integrated restraints (SIR) only)
</li><li>Front row outboard safety belt retractors, located in the seat back (vehicles with SIR only)
</li><li>Front row center safety belt retractor, located in back of the seat backrest, mounted to the back panel (regular cab)
</li><li>Belt tension sensor (BTS), located at the safety belt anchor point of the passenger front outboard safety belt
</li><li>Second row outboard safety belt retractors, located behind the rear quarter trim panels
</li><li>Second row center safety belt retractor located in back of the seat backrest, mounted to the back panel
</li><li>Second row safety belt buckle assemblies, attached to the floor pan
</li><li>Second row child safety seat tether anchors, at all seating positions, attached to back of cab behind the second row seat
</li><li>Second row lower anchors and tethers for children (LATCH) at all seating positions, attached to the seat risers and floor pan
</li></ul><div><a name="extract_64">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Safety Belt Buckle and Pretensioner
</b></p><p>The safety belt buckle and pretensioner is a pyrotechnic device that removes excess webbing from the safety belt when deployed. The pretensioner works in conjunction with the front air bag system. When the pretensioners deploy, this causes the
buckle to move downward, removing excess webbing from the lap and shoulder safety belts.
</p><p>If the vehicle is involved in a collision that results in deployment of the safety belt pretensioners, a new driver and passenger seat belt system (including safety belt buckle and pretensioners, safety belt retractors and height adjusters)
must be installed.
</p><p>For safety belt buckle pretensioner diagnostic information, refer to

<p><b>Belt Tension Sensor (BTS)
</b></p><p>The safety belt tension sensor (BTS) is part of the passenger front outboard safety belt and retractor assembly and is not serviced separately. The safety BTS is located at the safety belt anchor point and is used in conjunction with the
occupant classification sensor (OCS) system. Refer to 
<a target="leftside" href="s62~tr~en~leftside=s62s1kbl.htm&rightside=s62s1kbr.htm&market=tr&lang=en~gen~2col.htm        "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               >Section 501-20B

child safety seats is still functioning correctly, in addition to other checks for correct safety belt system function. A new belt and retractor assembly must be installed if the safety belt assembly's ALR feature or any other safety belt function
is not operating correctly when checked according to the procedures in the workshop manual. Failure to install a new belt and retractor assembly could increase the risk of injury in collisions.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When installing a new dual locking mode retractor, the retractor should be checked to make sure it is not in the automatic locking retractor (ALR) mode after installation in the stowed position.
</p><p>All continuous-loop, 3-point retractor systems (except the driver position) are equipped with the dual locking mode system.
</p><p>The emergency locking retractor (ELR) mode will allow the occupant freedom of movement, locking tight only on hard braking, hard cornering or an impact of approximately 8 km/h (5 mph). The ELR mode helps to reduce the forward movement of the
driver and passengers. The ELR mode is continuously in operation at all seating positions.
</p><p>The ALR portion of this system does not allow the occupant freedom of movement. The ALR mode is used when locking a child seat in a seating position or when a tight belt fit is desired. The ALR mode is disengaged when the webbing is free to
move in or out of the retractor. The ALR mode is automatically engaged when the webbing is fully extracted from the retractor and then allowed to retract. As the webbing is retracted back onto the spool an audible clicking sound is made indicating
that the retractor is in ALR mode. The ALR mode is automatically disengaged when most of the webbing is retracted back onto the spool.
</p><p>The automatic locking mode must be used when installing a child safety seat in the front or rear passenger seating positions, where dual locking mode retractors are provided.
</p><p><b>Energy Management Retractor
</b></p><p>This vehicle has a safety belt system with an energy management feature at the front seating positions to help further reduce the risk of injury in the event of a head-on collision.
</p><p>The energy management retractor feature is designed to pay out webbing in a controlled manner. This feature is designed to help reduce the belt force acting on an occupant's chest.

<p><b>Fastening Safety Belts
</b></p><p><b><IMG src="ani_caut.gif"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        border="0">&nbsp;WARNING:  Do not introduce slack into the safety belt system because the belt locks upon impact where it is positioned. Use the shoulder safety belt on the outside shoulder only. Never wear the shoulder safety belt under the arm. Never swing the shoulder
safety belt around the neck over the inside shoulder. Never use a single belt for more than one person. Make sure the lap portion of the belt is fitted snugly and as low as possible around the hips, not the waist. Failure to follow these precautions
could increase the chance and severity of injury in a collision.
</b></p><p>Always follow the preceding safety precautions when fastening the safety belts.
</p><p><b>Safety Belt Extension Assembly
</b></p><p>In certain cases, the safety belt may be too short even when it is fully extended. About 20 cm (8 in) can be added to the belt length by using a safety belt extension. Safety belt extensions are available at no cost from any Ford or
Lincoln-Mercury dealer parts department. Safety belt extensions are only available with black webbing.
</p><p>Use only extensions manufactured by the same supplier as the safety belt. Manufacturer identification is located at the end of the webbing on the label. Also, use the safety belt extension only if the safety belt is too short for you when fully
extended. Do not use an extension to change the fit of the shoulder belt across the torso.

<b>MUST
</b> be securely tightened to specification. Otherwise, the child safety seat may not be correctly secured and the child could be injured if the vehicle is involved in a collision or stops
suddenly.
</b></p><p>The second row child safety seat tether anchors are located directly behind the seat, attached to the back of the cab.
</p><p>If the child safety seat tether anchors were in use during a collision, inspect and install new anchors as necessary. Return the vehicle structure to its original production configuration.
</p><div><a name="extract_69">&nbsp;

<p><b>Attaching Safety Seats With Tether Straps
</b></p><p>Some manufacturers make child safety seats that include a tether strap that goes over the back of the vehicle seat and attaches to an anchoring point. Other manufacturers offer the tether strap as an accessory. Contact the manufacturer of the
child safety seat for information about ordering a tether strap.
</p><p>Refer to 
<a href="s621ka20.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Child Safety Seat Tether Anchor

</a></div>

<p><b>Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH)
</b></p><p>The lower anchors and tethers for children (LATCH) system is a standardized and uniform attachment system for installing child safety seats in passenger vehicles. LATCH-equipped child safety seats have 2 lower attachments that connect to the
vehicle portion of the LATCH system.
</p><p>The vehicle portion of the system consists of 2 attachment points (6 mm wires) attached to the rear seat risers and floor pan (SuperCab and SuperCrew). The attachment points protrude from the biteline between the seat cushion and seat backrest.
</p><p>If a child safety seat was in use during a collision, inspect the vehicle portion of the system for damage. If any of the attachment points (6 mm wires) are damaged, install a new LATCH assembly. Refer to the appropriate procedure in the
Removal and Installation portion of this section.
</p><p><b>Safety Belt Warning Indicator and Chime
</b></p><p>The warning indicator and chime are reminders to fasten the safety belt. The system operates as follows:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>If the driver safety belt is not buckled in the first 6 seconds after the ignition switch is turned to the RUN or START position, the indicator will illuminate and the chime will toggle from ON to OFF for 6 seconds, for one minute.
</li><li>If the driver safety belt is buckled while the indicator is on and the chime is sounding, both the indicator and chime will turn off.
</li><li>If the safety belt is buckled before the ignition is turned to the ON position, neither the indicator nor the chime will turn on.
</li></ul><div><a name="extract_71">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Belt Minder
</b></p><p>The Belt Minder feature is a supplemental warning to the safety belt warning function. This feature provides an additional reminder to the driver that the driver and/or passenger safety belt is unbuckled by intermittently sounding a chime and
illuminating the safety belt warning lamp in the instrument cluster.
</p><p>The passenger Belt Minder feature is activated only when the occupant classification sensor (OCS) system detects a passenger in the right front seat and the passenger weight exceeds a programmed limit.
</p><p>To activate or deactivate the Belt Minder feature, refer to
