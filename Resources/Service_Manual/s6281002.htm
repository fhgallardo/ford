</h4><meta name="tps_proctitle" content="Clutch">

<p>The primary function of the clutch is to couple and uncouple engine power to the transmission upon driver command.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>The clutch is a single plate, dry friction clutch disc. The clutch disc has a splined hub (with integral torsional dampening springs) which attaches the clutch disc to the input shaft.
</li><li>Engine output is coupled to the input shaft by the friction existing between the clutch disc facings and the flywheel/clutch pressure plate assembly. The extent of this friction is directly related to the composition of the facing material and
the magnitude of the clamping force exerted by the clutch pressure plate. These factors limit the amount of torque that can be transmitted without slippage.
</li><li>The clamping force is obtained from a diaphragm spring contained within the clutch pressure plate assembly. This force is developed during the attachment of the clutch pressure plate to the flywheel.
</li><li>The clutch system is disengaged when the clutch pedal is depressed and engaged when the clutch pedal is released. This displacement removes the spring load from the clutch pressure plate and eliminates the coupling friction between the engine
and the transmission.
