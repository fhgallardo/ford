Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal injury.
</b></p><p>The 4.6L (281 CID) is a V-8 engine with the following features:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Single overhead camshaft
</li><li>Two valves per cylinder
</li><li>Sequential multiport fuel injection (SFI)
</li><li>Aluminum cylinder heads
</li><li>Cast iron, 90-degree V-cylinder block
</li><li>Individually chain-driven camshafts with a hydraulic timing chain tensioner on each timing chain
</li><li>Electronic ignition system with 8 ignition coils
</li><li>Electronic returnless fuel system
</li></ul><p><b>Identification
</b></p><p>Always refer to these labels when installation of new parts is necessary, or when checking engine calibrations. The engine parts often differ within a CID family. Verification of the identification codes will make sure that the correct parts
are obtained. These codes contain all the pertinent information relating to the dates, optional equipment and revisions. The Ford Master Parts Catalog contains a complete listing of the codes and their application.
</p><p><b>Code Information
</b></p><p>The engine code information label, located on the side of the valve cover and the front side of the valve cover, contains the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Engine build date
</li><li>Engine plant code
</li><li>Engine code
</li></ul><p><b>Exhaust Emission Control System
</b></p><p>Operation and necessary maintenance of the exhaust emission control devices used on this engine are covered in the Powertrain Control/Emissions Diagnosis (PC/ED) manual.
</p><p><b>Induction System
</b></p><p>The sequential multiport fuel injection (SFI) provides the fuel/air mixture needed for combustion in the cylinders. The 8 solenoid-operated fuel injectors:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>are mounted in the intake manifold.
</li><li>meter fuel into the air intake stream in accordance with engine demand.
</li><li>are positioned so that their tips direct fuel just ahead of the engine intake valves.
</li><li>are connected in series with the fuel pressure sensor.
</li><li>supply fuel from the fuel tank with a fuel pump mounted in the fuel tank.
</li></ul><p>A constant fuel pressure is maintained across the fuel injectors by the fuel pressure sensor. The fuel pressure sensor:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>is positioned upstream from the fuel injectors on the fuel injection supply manifold.
</li></ul><p><b>Valve Train
</b></p><p>The valve train operates as follows:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Ball-tip hydraulic lash adjusters provide automatic lash adjustment.
</li><li>Roller followers ride on the camshaft lobe, transferring the up-and-down motion of the camshafts to the valves in the cylinder heads.
</li></ul><p><b>Positive Crankcase Ventilation System
</b></p><p>All engines are equipped with a closed-type positive crankcase ventilation system recycling the crankcase vapors to the upper intake manifold.
</p><p><b>Lubrication System
</b></p><p>The engine lubrication system operates as follows:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Oil is drawn into the oil pump through the oil pump screen cover and tube in the sump of the oil pan.
</li><li>Oil is pumped through the oil filter on the left front side of the cylinder block.
</li><li>Oil enters the main gallery where it is distributed to the crankshaft main journals and to both cylinder heads.
</li><li>From the main journals, the oil is routed through cross-drilled passages in the crankshaft to lubricate the connecting rod bearings. Controlled leakage through the crankshaft main bearings and connecting rod bearings is slung radially outward
to cool and lubricate the cylinder walls as well as the entire connecting rod, piston and piston ring assembly.
</li><li>The left cylinder head is fed from a drilling into the supply passage feeding the main gallery at the front of the cylinder block. The right cylinder head is fed from a drilling into the rear of the main gallery. Main gallery pressure is
reduced as it enters the cylinder head galleries through fixed serviceable orifices, located at the upper part of the feed passages. It is this reduced pressure in the cylinder head galleries which feeds the camshaft journals, the hydraulic lash
adjusters and the primary and secondary timing chain tensioners.
</li><li>The camshaft lobe and roller followers are lubricated by splash created through valve train operation.
</li></ul><p><b>Oil Pump
</b></p><p>The lubrication system of the 4.6L (2V) engine is designed to provide optimum oil flow to critical components of the engine through its entire operating range. The heart of the system is a positive displacement internal gear oil pump using top
seal rotors. Generically this design is known as a gerotor pump, which operates as follows:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>The oil pump is mounted on the front face of the cylinder block.
</li><li>The inner rotor is piloted on the crankshaft post and is driven through flats on the crankshaft.
</li><li>System pressure is limited by an integral, internally-vented relief valve which directs the bypassed oil back to the inlet side of the oil pump.
</li><li>Oil pump displacement has been selected to provide adequate volume to make sure of correct oil pressure, both at hot idle and maximum speed.
</li><li>The relief valve calibration protects the system from excessive pressure during high viscosity conditions.
</li><li>The relief valve is designed to provide adequate connecting rod bearing lubrication under high-temperature and high-speed conditions.
