every collision. All new belt assemblies should be installed unless a qualified technician finds the assemblies show no damage and operate correctly. Belt assemblies not in use during a collision should also be inspected and new assemblies installed
if either damage or incorrect operation is noted. Failure to follow these instructions could increase the risk of injury in collisions.

Always wear safety glasses when repairing an air bag equipped vehicle and when handling a safety belt buckle pretensioner or safety belt retractor pretensioner. Never probe a pretensioner
electrical connector. Doing so could result in pretensioner or air bag deployment. Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal injury.
