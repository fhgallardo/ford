</h5><IMG src="gr1505a.gif"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        height="174" width="269" border="1"><p>This system allows automatic positioning of the driver seat outside rearview mirrors (Lincoln) and power adjuster pedals (Lincoln) to 2 programmable positions.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A power driver seat position can be stored at any time. The driver must move the seat to the desired position using the driver seat switch assembly. The driver must then depress the memory SET switch which activates the memory SET switch light
emitting diode (LED). Within 5 seconds (before the LED goes out), the driver must select a memory position. Memory 1 is selected by depressing memory switch 1. Memory 2 is selected by depressing memory switch 2.
</li><li>If no memory switch input is received within the 5-second time limit, the operation is aborted and the memory SET switch LED is turned off. This also occurs if one of the following inputs is received during the 5-second programming limit:

<ul type="square"><li>Power driver seat switch
</li><li>Memory SET switch
</li><li>Power adjustable pedal switch
</li></ul></li></ul><p>A position can only be recalled when the transmission selector is in PARK or NEUTRAL. A position may be programmed at any time.
</p><p><b>Heated Seats
</b></p><p>This system allows the electrical heating of the front seats on passenger demand.
</p><p>The components of the system are:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>the seat heating elements located in the seat cushion and backrest.
</li><li>the heated seat module located on the seat cushion pan.
</li><li>the heated seat control switch, located on the electronic automatic temperature control (EATC) module.
</li><li>temperature sensor is located in the seat cushion heating element.

carrying out the OCS system reset. Failure to follow these instructions can increase the risk of personal injury or death in a crash.

A scan tool is used to trigger the command to carry out the OCS
system reset.

<ul type="square"><li>Make sure the OCS system components are connected and no faults are present.
</li><li>Make sure voltage to the OCS module is above 8.0 volts and less than 18.0 volts.
</li><li>Make sure the OCS system is not at a temperature below 6&#176;C (42&#176;F) or above 36&#176;C (97&#176;F) when initiating the OCS system reset process. If the vehicle has been exposed to extreme cold or hot temperatures, the vehicle must be
exposed and kept at a temperature within the limits, 6&#176;C to 36&#176;C (42&#176;F to 97&#176;F) for a minimum of 30 minutes.
</li><li>Make sure nothing is present on the passenger seat before carrying out the OCS system reset and nothing is placed on the seat during the process.
</li><li>Make sure a minimum 4-second time period has passed after cycling the ignition switch ON before carrying out the OCS system reset process.
</li></ul></b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the first attempt to carry out the OCS system reset is unsuccessful, a second attempt must be made. If the second attempt to carry out the OCS system reset is unsuccessful, a new OCS system service kit must be installed.
