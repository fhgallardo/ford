self-test DTC, program the PATS keys.

</A> in this section. No parts need to be replaced for this DTC.
</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="CENTER">B1602
</TD><TD valign="top" align="LEFT">Partial PATS key was read. Make sure that an approved PATS key (Ford, Rotunda, ILCO, Strattec, HUF, or Valeo) is being used. Large metal objects, additional PATS keys, or devices used to purchase gasoline located on the customer's key ring can
cause interference. Instruct the customer to keep such items from touching the ignition key during engine start. It is not necessary to remove the objects from the customer's key ring. Remote starter equipment can also cause this DTC. Remove any
remote starter equipment close to the transceiver before conducting further diagnosis. This DTC can be caused by the PATS key or the PATS transceiver.
</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="CENTER">B1681
</TD><TD valign="top" align="LEFT">PATS transceiver module signal is not received by the PCM. This DTC can be caused by the circuits between the PATS transceiver and the PCM, the PATS transceiver, or the PCM. Follow the pinpoint test for diagnosis. This can also be caused by
using the incorrect transceiver part number. Make sure that the correct transceiver part number is being used.
