<p><b>Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) Hydraulic Control Unit Bleeding
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  This procedure is only required when a new hydraulic control unit (HCU) is installed.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When any part of the hydraulic system has been disconnected for repair or new installation, air may get into the system and cause spongy brake pedal action. This requires bleeding of the hydraulic system after it has been correctly connected.
The hydraulic system can be gravity bled, manually bled or bled with pressure bleeding equipment.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Connect the diagnostic tool and follow the ABS system bleed instructions.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Use the gravity bleed or manual bleed procedure(s) to bleed the system. Begin at the RH rear caliper.
