Failure to do so puts the shop's bulk refrigerant at risk of contamination. If the vehicle's A/C refrigerant is contaminated, refer the customer to
the service facility that carried out the last A/C service. If the customer wishes to pay the additional cost, use the A/C recovery equipment that is designated for recovering contaminated A/C refrigerant. All contaminated A/C refrigerant must be
disposed of as hazardous waste. For all equipment, follow the equipment manufacturer's procedures and instructions.

the A/C system. Internal plumbing of these devices makes it impossible to correctly remove any foreign material/debris. These components are typically discarded after A/C system contamination. Hoses without mufflers can normally be reused unless
they are clogged with foreign material. The filter is intended for use on one vehicle only.
