<p><b>Weld-Bonding &#8212; Squeeze-Type Resistance Spot Welding (STRSW) Method
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Ford Motor Company does not approve or recognize structural repair procedures using anything but genuine Ford parts.

<p>Structural repairs (frames, rails, aprons and body panels) carried out using other than Ford Motor Company parts have not been tested. In addition, structural equivalence and corrosion protection cannot be assured.
</p><p>Returning a vehicle to pre-accident condition can only be assured if repair procedures are carried out by skilled technicians using genuine Ford Motor Company parts and approved methods.
</p><p>Structural component repair procedures approved by Ford using genuine parts have been validated through testing by Ford Motor Company engineers. Should alternative structural component repair procedures and/or parts be used, repairers should be
aware of the potential liability they incur.
</p></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Corrosion protection needs to be restored whenever it is necessary to grind through painted surfaces or E-coat, or when bare metal repairs are made. For additional information, refer to Restoring Corrosion Protection Following Repair in this
section.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Door shells are manufactured with structural adhesives only, weld bonding door skins is not recommended. Only metal bonding adhesive should be used.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Weld-bonding is a method used to join metals using squeeze-type resistance spot welding (STRSW) or metal inert gas welding (MIG) and structural adhesive. The steps listed in this procedure apply to both types of welding. STRSW is the preferred
method. MIG welding should only be used when areas to be welded cannot be accessed using STRSW-type machinery.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Factory spot welds should be substituted with either resistance spot welds or MIG plug welds. Spot/plug welds should equal factory welds in both location and quantity. Do not place a new spot weld directly over an original weld location. Plug
weld hole should equal 8 mm (0.31 in) diameter.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Verify the vehicle is dimensionally correct on a frame machine. Straighten if necessary.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Remove damaged panels with an air saw or air chisel. Remove only large portions of the damaged panel. Avoid cutting into mating flanges or adjacent parts.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Drill out the spot welds using an appropriate spot-weld cutter and remove the remaining portions of the panel to be replaced.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Prepare any damaged flanges on the vehicle using hammer and dolly.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Grind the mating surface of the original flanges not greater than 25 mm (0.98 in) where the metal bonding adhesive will be applied.

<ul type="disc"><li>Be sure to remove galvanizing on metal. Metal should have a shiny appearance.
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>Be careful not to damage the corners or thin the metal. The E-coat should also be removed on the opposite side of the flange only where the spot welds are to be placed.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li>Bevel any edges to less than 10 degrees on the new panel where a finished section joint is needed.
</li></ol>

<ol start="7"><li>Dry-fit and clamp the replacement service parts to verify a correct fit.

<ul type="disc"><li>Remove the service part after verifying correct fit and alignment.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="8"><li>If MIG welding, refer to Weld-Bonding &#8212; MIG Welding Method in this section.
</li></ol>

<ol start="9"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The ends of welding clamps should be insulated on the ends using tape or similar material when welding is carried out.
</p>Follow manufacturer's prescribed welding procedures and settings. For additional information, refer to

</li></ol>

<ol start="10"><li>Prepare the adhesive. Dispense a small amount of metal bonding adhesive from the cartridge to make sure of an even flow of both components. Attach the mixing tip and dispense a mixing tip length of adhesive to make sure of a correct mix ratio.
</li></ol>

<ol start="11"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Working time of the adhesive is 40-50 minutes at 21&#176;C (70&#176;F). For every -7&#176;C (20&#176;F) above 21&#176;C (70&#176;F), decrease the working time by one half. For every -7&#176;C (20&#176;F) below 21&#176;C (70&#176;F), double the working
and cure time.
</p>Create a test sample.

<ol start="1"> 
<li>Prepare the metal and adhesive as described. Apply a 6-9 mm (0.23-0.35 in) bead of adhesive and weld the sample.
</li></ol><ol start="2"> 
<li>Place the welded sample in a vice and perform destructive weld tests by peeling the scrap metal apart using large channel lock-type pliers. Measure the weld nugget to determine that the nugget meets Ford weld nugget requirements.
</li></ol><ol start="3"> 
<li>When the correct weld nugget is achieved, the service part can be weld-bonded.

<ol start="15"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Welding can be carried out anytime during the adhesive curing process, or after the adhesive is fully cured. Welder settings will vary when welding through wet adhesive versus welding through fully cured adhesive. Refer to welder manufacturer's
recommended settings for welding through fully cured adhesive. It is recommended to place a shunt weld in an area with no adhesive to make sure of conductivity, particularly when welding through fully cured adhesive.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If welding will not be carried out immediately, allow a minimum of 1.5 to 2 hours of adhesive cure time at 21&#176;C (70&#176;F) before removing clamps. Cure time at lower temperatures should be increased. Clamps may be removed immediately after
the component is welded.

<p><b>Weld-Bonding &#8212; MIG Welding Method
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Metal inert gas (MIG) weld-bonding can be substituted as an alternative to squeeze type resistance spot welding (STRSW). It may only be used to weld areas that are inaccessible to STRSW machinery. However when accessible STRSW is the preferred
method.
