<p><b>Iron Oxide (Rail Dust) or Acid Rain Decontamination
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Iron oxide contamination appears as tiny rust spots on horizontal surfaces and in severe cases can be felt. This damage is typically caused from rail shipment, storage near railroad tracks or fallout from industrial manufacturing facilities.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Acid rain contamination can be identified as water spotting and in severe cases staining within the water spots.
