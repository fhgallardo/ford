<p>The roof opening panel assembly uses an integrated motor and module to operate the roof opening panel. A new roof opening panel motor and module are installed as an assembly. The roof opening panel is an electronically operated glass panel that
can be opened or closed by the roof opening panel switch. Actuating the switch in either a FORWARD or REARWARD motion supplies a ground to the roof opening panel motor/module. The VENT and SOFT-STOP functions are controlled by the roof opening panel
motor/module. The roof opening panel has an express open feature activated when the switch is pressed momentarily. This function is controlled by the roof opening panel motor/module.
</p><p>A new roof opening panel motor will only open and must be initialized. The roof opening panel motor initialization procedure must be done when repairs are carried out on any part of the roof opening panel system, including: any time the roof
opening panel motor has been removed from the roof opening panel assembly, a new roof opening panel motor has been installed, or when a new roof opening panel assembly has been installed.
