</b>  If a seat equipped with a seat mounted side air bag and/or a safety belt pretensioner (if equipped) system is being serviced,

</b>  The air bag warning lamp illuminates when the RCM fuse is removed and the ignition switch is ON. This is normal operation and does not indicate a supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault.

</p>

<ol start="1"><li>Turn all vehicle accessories OFF.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Turn the ignition switch to OFF.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>At the central junction box (CJB), located below the RH side of the instrument panel, remove the trim panel, the cover, and the restraints control module (RCM) fuse 19 (10A) from the CJB. For additional information, refer to the Wiring Diagram
Manual.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Turn the ignition ON and visually monitor the air bag indicator for at least 30 seconds. The air bag indicator will remain lit continuously (no flashing) if the correct RCM fuse has been removed. If the air bag indicator does not remain lit
continuously, remove the correct RCM fuse before proceeding.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Turn the ignition OFF.

</b></p>Make sure all restraint system diagnostic tool(s) that may have been installed during the repair have been removed from the vehicle and all SRS components are connected.

</b></p>Connect the battery ground cable.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Prove out the supplemental restraint system (SRS) as follows:

<br>Turn the ignition key from ON to OFF. Wait 10 seconds, then turn the key back to ON and visually monitor the air bag indicator with the air bag modules installed. The air bag indicator will light continuously for approximately 6 seconds and
then turn off. If an air bag supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault is present, the air bag indicator will:

<br>- fail to light.

<br>- remain lit continuously.

<br>- flash.

<br>The flashing might not occur until approximately 30 seconds after the ignition switch has been turned from the OFF to the ON position. This is the time required for the restraints control module (RCM) to complete the testing of the SRS. If the
air bag indicator is inoperative and a SRS fault exists, a chime will sound in a pattern of 5 sets of 5 beeps. If this occurs, the air bag indicator and any SRS fault discovered must be diagnosed and repaired.

<br>Clear all continuous DTCs from the restraints control module using a diagnostic tool.
