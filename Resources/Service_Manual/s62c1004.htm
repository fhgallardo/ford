<p><b>Electronic Manual Temperature Control
</b></p><p>The electronic manual temperature control (EMTC) components are used to select the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Air inlet source (outside or recirculated)
</li><li>Blower motor speed
</li><li>Discharge air temperature (temperature blend)
</li><li>Discharge air location (defrost, panel, floor)
</li><li>A/C compressor operation
</li></ul><p><b>Control System Inputs
</b></p><p>The EMTC system has 2 system control inputs.
</p><p><b>EMTC Module (Climate Control Assembly)
</b></p><p>The climate control assembly integrates the temperature control, mode function selection, A/C request button, recirculated air request button and rear defog button into a single unit.
</p><p>The temperature control switch setting determines air temperature. Movement of the temperature knob from COOL (blue) to WARM (red) causes a corresponding movement of the temperature blend door and determines the air discharge temperature that
the air distribution system will maintain. The temperature control switch is an integral part of the climate control assembly and cannot be installed separately.
</p><p>The A/C request button determines A/C compressor operation, except when the function selected is OFF, MAX A/C, DEFROST or FLOOR/DEFROST. The A/C request button is an integral part of the climate control assembly and cannot be installed
separately.
</p><p>The recirculated air request button can select recirculated air in any mode except MAX A/C, OFF or DEFROST.
</p><p>The rear defog button (if equipped) signals activation of the heated backlight and heated exterior rear view mirrors. The rear defog button is an integral part of the climate control assembly and cannot be installed separately.
</p><p>The heated mirror button (if equipped) signals activation of the heated exterior rear view mirrors. The heated mirror button is an integral part of the climate control assembly and cannot be installed separately.
</p><p>The EMTC module is not equipped with self-test capabilities.
</p><p><b>Blower Motor Switch
</b></p><p>The blower motor switch is mounted in the climate control assembly and controls blower motor speed by adding or bypassing resistors in the blower motor resistor in all function selector switch positions except OFF.
</p><p><b>Control System Outputs
</b></p><p>The EMTC system has 3 system outputs.
</p><p><b>Blower Motor Resistor
</b></p><p>The blower motor resistor adjusts the blower motor speed based on the blower motor switch setting. The blower motor resistor contains 3 resistor coils in series. The end of each resistor coil is wired to a setting in the blower motor switch.
Voltage from the blower motor relay is available at the blower motor at all times when the blower selector is in an ON position, and then continues to the blower motor resistor. The blower motor switch will allow a path to ground with the addition
of 1, 2 or 3 coils in the blower motor resistor to the circuit. When the blower motor switch is in the MED HI position, the blower motor switch will add a path to ground through one coil in the blower motor resistor. When the blower motor switch is
in the MED LO position, the blower motor switch will add a path to ground through 2 coils (in series) in the blower motor resistor. When the blower motor switch is in the LO position, the blower motor switch will add a path to ground through 3 coils
(in series) in the blower motor resistor. When the blower motor switch is in the HI position, the blower motor resistor is bypassed.
</p><p><b>Temperature Blend Door Actuator
</b></p><p>An electric temperature blend door actuator is used to position the temperature blend door. The temperature blend door actuator contains a reversible electric motor to position the temperature blend door. A potentiometer is installed in the
actuator to allow the EMTC module to monitor the position of the temperature blend door. The potentiometer circuit consists of a 5-volt reference signal connected to one end of a variable resistor, and a signal ground connected to the other. A
signal return circuit is connected to a wiper which is driven along the variable resistor by the actuator shaft. The signal returned to the EMTC module from the wiper indicates the position of the temperature blend door.
</p><p><b>Mode Door Actuator
</b></p><p>Electric mode door actuators are used to position the air flow mode doors and air inlet mode door. The 2 mode door actuators each contain a reversible electric motor to position the air flow mode door. A potentiometer is installed in the
defrost/panel/floor door actuator to allow the EMTC module to monitor the position of the air flow mode doors. The potentiometer circuit consists of a 5-volt reference signal connected to one end of a variable resistor, and a signal ground connected
to the other. A signal return circuit is connected to a wiper which is driven along the variable resistor by the actuator shaft. The signal returned to the EMTC module from the wiper indicates the position of the air flow mode door. The air inlet
mode door actuator is driven to the full RECIRC or full FRESH air inlet position, and does not require a potentiometer circuit to monitor its position.
</p><p><b>Electronic Automatic Temperature Control
</b></p><p>The electronic automatic temperature control (EATC) module analyzes input from the following major sources:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Temperature, air flow direction and blower selection (made by the vehicle occupants)
</li><li>In-vehicle temperature
</li><li>Ambient temperature
</li><li>Sunload
</li><li>Vehicle speed
</li><li>Engine coolant temperature
</li></ul><p>Using these inputs, the EATC module determines the correct conditions for the following outputs:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>A/C compressor operation
</li><li>Blower speed
</li><li>Temperature blend door position
</li><li>Defrost/panel/floor door position
</li><li>Air inlet door position
</li></ul><p><b>Control System Inputs
</b></p><p>The EATC system has 5 control system inputs.
</p><h5>EATC Module (Climate Control Assembly)
</h5><p>The EATC module provides an interface for the vehicle occupants to control the climate control system, or automatically controls the climate control system in the AUTO mode. The EATC module has a vacuum fluorescent display for displaying set
temperature, air flow direction, blower speed and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). An on-board diagnostic (OBD) feature is incorporated to supply the technician with DTCs. These DTCs help direct the technician to the inoperative component.
</p><p>The EATC module display will switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit when the instrument cluster display is toggled.
</p><h5>Steering Wheel Audio/Climate Control Switch
</h5><p>The steering wheel audio/climate control switch allows the driver to adjust the passenger compartment temperature setting and manually override the blower motor speed setting.
</p><h5>In-Vehicle Temperature Sensor
</h5><p>An in-vehicle temperature sensor is used by the EATC module to measure air temperature inside the passenger compartment. An aspirator hose and elbow is connected between the heater core housing and the in-vehicle temperature sensor. Air flow
through the heater core and evaporator core housing causes a venturi-type suction through the aspirator hose which draws passenger compartment air across the thermistor in the in-vehicle temperature sensor.
</p><h5>Solar Radiation Sensor (Sunload Sensor)
</h5><p>The solar radiation sensor supplies information to the EATC module indicating sunload.
</p><h5>Ambient Temperature Sensor
</h5><p>The ambient temperature sensor signal is received by the instrument cluster module which communicates it to the EATC module via the vehicles UBP network.
</p><p><b>Control System Outputs
</b></p><p>The EATC system has 3 control system outputs.
</p><h5>Blower Motor Speed Control
</h5><p>The blower motor speed control controls the blower motor speed by converting low power signals from the EATC module to a high current, variable ground feed for the blower motor. A delay function is used to provide a gradual increase or decrease
in blower motor speed under all conditions.
</p><p>The blower motor speed control is located on the heater core and evaporator core housing near the blower motor.
</p><h5>Temperature Blend Door Actuator
</h5><p>An electric temperature blend door actuator is used to position the temperature blend door. The temperature blend door actuator contains a reversible electric motor to position the temperature blend door. A potentiometer is installed in the
actuator to allow the EATC module to monitor the position of the temperature blend door. The potentiometer circuit consists of a 5-volt reference signal connected to one end of a variable resistor, and a signal ground connected to the other. A
signal return circuit is connected to a wiper which is driven along the variable resistor by the actuator shaft. The signal returned to the EATC module from the wiper indicates the position of the temperature blend door.
</p><h5>Mode Door Actuators
</h5><p>Electric mode door actuators are used to position the air flow mode doors and air inlet mode door. The 2 mode door actuators each contain a reversible electric motor to position the airflow mode door. A potentiometer is installed in the
defrost/panel/floor door actuator to allow the EATC module to monitor the position of the air flow mode doors. The potentiometer circuit consists of a 5-volt reference signal connected to one end of a variable resistor, and a signal ground connected
to the other. A signal return circuit is connected to a wiper which is driven along the variable resistor by the actuator shaft. The signal returned to the EATC module from the wiper indicates the position of the air flow mode door. The air inlet
mode door actuator is driven to the full RECIRC or full FRESH air inlet position, and does not require a potentiometer circuit to monitor its position.
