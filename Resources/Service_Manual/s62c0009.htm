<p><b>Fluorescent Dye Injection &#8212; Using an A/C Refrigerant Center and Dye Injector
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Fluorescent refrigerant system dye is added to the refrigerant system at the factory to assist in refrigerant system leak diagnosis using a Rotunda-approved ultraviolet blacklight. It is not necessary to add additional dye to the refrigerant
system before diagnosing leaks, even if a significant amount of refrigerant has been removed from the system. Replacement suction accumulators and receiver/driers are shipped with a fluorescent dye "wafer" included in the desiccant bag which will
dissolve after approximately 30 minutes of continued A/C operation. It is not necessary to add dye after flushing or filtering the refrigerant system because a new suction accumulator or receiver/drier is installed as part of the flushing or
filtering procedure. Additional refrigerant system dye should only be added if more than 50% of the refrigerant system lubricant capacity has been lost due to a fitting separation, hose rupture or other damage.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Before using the R-134a fluorescent dye injector for the first time, refer to the manufacturer's instructions on evacuation of any non-condensable gasses from the hoses.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Only connect the R-134a fluorescent dye injector to a manifold and gauge set or R-134a service center when fluorescent dye is to be injected. The R-134a fluorescent dye injector has a one way check valve that will prevent refrigerant system
recovery and evacuation.
