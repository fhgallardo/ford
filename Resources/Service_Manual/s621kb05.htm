</a><p><b>Pinpoint Test A: The Air Bag Warning Indicator Is Illuminated Continuously &#8212; RCM Disconnected or Inoperative, Loss of Battery Feed or Loss of Signal Ground
</b></p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>During normal operation, the air bag indicator will illuminate continuously for approximately 6 seconds and then go out after the ignition switch is placed in the ON or START position and no air bag fault exists. The air bag indicator will
remain illuminated continuously after 5 cycles of a lamp fault code (LFC), if a fault exists. Refer to 
<a href="s621kb02.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Air Bag and Safety Belt Pretensioner Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)
</a> in this section. Be sure to cycle
the ignition switch and look for an approximate 6-second indicator prove-out without LFCs.
</p><p>The restraints control module (RCM) will communicate diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) to the diagnostic tool through the data link connector (DLC). If the diagnostic tool displays NO COMMUNICATION when retrieving continuous DTCs,

</h5><p>During normal operation, the air bag indicator will illuminate continuously for approximately 6 seconds and then go out after the ignition switch is placed to the ON or START and no air bag fault exists. The air bag indicator will remain
illuminated continuously after 5 cycles of a lamp fault code (LFC), if a fault exists.

</b></p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>The connection between the instrument cluster module and restraints control module (RCM) is used to signal a chime if the primary air bag indicator is inoperative and another SRS fault exists. The RCM monitors this connection to the instrument
cluster module at C310a pin 22.

</p><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>An air bag tone warning circuit short to battery or ignition can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>damaged wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a damaged or inoperative instrument cluster module.

</b></p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>The connection between the instrument cluster module and restraints control module (RCM) is used to signal a chime if the primary air bag indicator is inoperative and another SRS fault exists. The RCM monitors this connection to the instrument
cluster module at C310a pin 22.
</p><p>If the RCM detects a short to ground or open on the connection to the cluster, it will store diagnostic trouble code (DTC) B1892 in memory and flash lamp fault code (LFC) 53 (or a higher priority code if one exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>An air bag tone warning indicator circuit short to ground or open can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>damaged wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a damaged or inoperative instrument cluster module.
</li><li>a faulted RCM.

<a href="s621kb02.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Air Bag and Safety Belt Pretensioner Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The RCM checks all of the front air bag circuits for faults. If the RCM detects one of the following faults on any of the front air bag circuits, it will store diagnostic trouble code (DTC) B2293 in memory, and depending on the fault, flash
either lamp fault code (LFC) 19 or 21 depending on the fault (or higher priority code if one exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><h5>Fault Conditions
</h5><p>The RCM monitors for the following fault conditions:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Low resistance
</li><li>High resistance or circuit open
</li><li>Circuit short to voltage
</li><li>Circuit short to ground
</li></ul><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>A driver air bag fault can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>damaged wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a faulty clockspring.
</li><li>a faulty driver air bag module.
</li><li>a faulted RCM.
</li></ul><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>A passenger air bag fault can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>damaged wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a faulty passenger air bag module.
</li><li>a faulted RCM.

</b></p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>As part of the SRS, the safety belt buckles are equipped with Hall-effect switches. The safety belt switches indicate to the restraints control module (RCM) whether the safety belts are buckled or unbuckled. Refer to

<a href="s621kb02.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Air Bag and Safety Belt Pretensioner Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)
</a> in this section.
</p><p>The RCM checks the passenger safety belt buckle switch circuits for faults. If the RCM detects an open circuit or a short to voltage fault, it will store diagnostic trouble code (DTC) B2692 in memory and flash lamp fault code (LFC) 52 (or
higher priority code if one exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>A passenger safety belt buckle switch short to battery fault can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a faulty passenger safety belt buckle switch.
</li><li>a faulty RCM.

</a><p><b>Pinpoint Test S: LFC 16/DTC B2909 &#8212; Belt Tension Sensor Fault
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  LFC 16 is shared between DTC B2290 and DTC B2909.
</p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>The belt tension sensor operates in conjunction with the occupant classification sensor (OCS) system. The OCS system interprets a variable voltage signal provided by the safety belt tension sensor to identify the possible presence of a child
safety seat in the front passenger seat. The voltage output of the belt tension sensor is proportional to the amount of tension applied to the sensor by the belt, no tension low voltage (approximately 0.95 volt), high tension high voltage
(approximately 3.8 volts).
</p><p>The OCS system checks the belt tension sensor circuits for faults. If the OCS detects one of the following faults on any of the belt tension sensor circuits, it will report the failure to the restraints control module (RCM). The RCM will store
diagnostic trouble code (DTC) B2909 in memory and flash either lamp fault code (LFC) 16 (or higher priority code if one exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><p>The OCS system components (seat wiring harness, seat cushion frame, seat cushion foam pad, bladder with pressure sensor and electronic control unit) are calibrated to each other and are serviced as an assembly. The OCS system components are not
to be installed separately with the exception of the belt tension sensor. If a new OCS system, OCS system component or seat cushion foam pad are needed, a new OCS system service kit (seat cushion foam pad, bladder with pressure sensor and electronic
control unit) must be installed as an assembly.
</p><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>A belt tension sensor circuit fault can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a faulted belt tension sensor.
</li><li>a faulted OCS system.
</li></ul><a name="S">&nbsp;
</a><h5>PINPOINT TEST S: LFC 16/DTC B2909 &#8212; BELT TENSION SENSOR FAULT
</h5>

<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Connector C3238 is located at the anchor point of the safety belt. On vehicles equipped with seat integrated restraints (SIR), the belt tension sensor is located on the outboard side of the passenger seat. On vehicles equipped without SIR, the
belt tension sensor is located near the base of the B-pillar.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  
<b>To identify between a production OCS system and an OCS system service kit (OCS service kit), inspect the OCS ECU electrical connector.
</b><p>A production OCS system allows the disconnect of the electrical connector from the OCS ECU.
</p><p>An OCS system service kit has the OCS ECU electrical connector glued to the ECU. It cannot and should not be disconnected or altered.
</p></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Most faults are due to connector and/or wiring concerns. Carry out a thorough Inspection and Verification before proceeding with the pinpoint test.

</a><p><b>Pinpoint Test T: LFC 15/DTC C1414 &#8212; Incorrect Module Design Level
</b></p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>The restraints control module (RCM) monitors the communication condition and circuits of the occupant classification sensor (OCS) sensor for an embedded vehicle ID. The RCM also utilizes C310a-20 and C310a-21 for identifying the correct RCM for
the vehicle. If the RCM detects an unexpected condition or code from the OCS system or detects a fault at C310a-20 or C310a-21, it will store diagnostic trouble code (DTC) C1414 in memory and flash lamp fault code (LFC) 15 (or higher priority code
if one exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  RCM connector C310a-20 should be populated with circuit 1203 (BK/LB) and C310a-21 should be no connect (open circuit) for all cab styles.
</p><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>An incorrect vehicle identification code can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>incorrect RCM for vehicle.
</li><li>incorrect OCS system for vehicle.
</li><li>wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li></ul><a name="T">&nbsp;
</a><h5>PINPOINT TEST T: LFC 15/DTC C1414 &#8212; INCORRECT MODULE DESIGN LEVEL
</h5>

<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Most faults are due to connector and/or wiring concerns. Carry out a thorough Inspection and Verification before proceeding with the pinpoint test.

</h5><p>The seat track position sensor informs the restraints control module (RCM) of the driver seat position.
</p><p>The RCM monitors the driver seat track position sensor circuits. If the RCM detects a current out-of-range condition, it will store diagnostic trouble code (DTC) C1948 in memory and flash lamp fault code (LFC) 49 (or higher priority code if one
exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><h5>Possible Causes

</b></p><h5>Normal Operation
</h5><p>The seat track position sensor informs the restraints control module (RCM) of the driver seat position.
</p><p>The RCM monitors the driver seat track position sensor circuits. If the RCM detects an open or short to battery, it will store diagnostic trouble code (DTC) C1981 in memory and flash lamp fault code (LFC) 49 (or higher priority code if one
exists) on the air bag indicator.
</p><h5>Possible Causes
</h5><p>A driver seat track position sensor open circuit or short to battery fault can be caused by:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>wiring, terminals or connectors.
</li><li>a faulty seat track position sensor.
