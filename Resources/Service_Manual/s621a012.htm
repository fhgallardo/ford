Always wear safety glasses when repairing an air bag equipped vehicle and when handling a safety belt buckle pretensioner or safety belt retractor pretensioner. Never probe a pretensioner
electrical connector. Doing so could result in pretensioner or air bag deployment and could result in personal injury.

<ul type="square"><li>Make sure the OCS system components are connected and no faults are present.
</li><li>Make sure the OCS system is not at a temperature below 0&#176;C (32&#176;F) or above 45&#176;C (113&#176;F) when initiating the rezeroing process. If the vehicle has been exposed to extreme cold or hot temperatures, the vehicle must be exposed and
kept at a temperature within the limits, 0&#176;C to 45&#176;C (32&#176;F to 113&#176;F) for a minimum of 30 minutes.
</li><li>Make sure nothing is present on the passenger seat before rezeroing and nothing is placed on the seat during the rezeroing process.
</li><li>Make sure a minimum 8-second time period has passed after cycling the ignition switch ON before the rezeroing process.
</li></ul></b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  For best results in rezeroing, the OCS system should be at or near room temperature, 10&#176;C to 29&#176;C (50&#176;F to 85&#176;F).
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If the first attempt to rezero the OCS system is unsuccessful, a second attempt must be made.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The ignition switch must be cycled after rezeroing the OCS system.
</p>Rezero the occupant classification sensor.

<ul type="disc"><li>With the front passenger seat empty, use a diagnostic tool to trigger the active command and rezero the occupant classification sensor.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="11"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The ignition switch must be cycled after rezeroing the OCS system.
</p>Cycle the ignition switch from ON to OFF.
</li></ol><p><b>All seats
</b><br>

<ol start="12"><li>Prove out the supplemental restraint system (SRS) as follows:

<br>Turn the ignition key from ON to OFF. Wait 10 seconds, then turn the key back to ON and visually monitor the air bag indicator with the air bag modules installed. The air bag indicator will light continuously for approximately 6 seconds and
then turn OFF. If an air bag supplemental restraint system (SRS) fault is present, the air bag indicator will:

<br>- fail to light.

<br>- remain lit continuously.

<br>- flash.

<br>The flashing might not occur until approximately 30 seconds after the ignition switch has been turned from the OFF to the ON position. This is the time required for the restraints control module (RCM) to complete the testing of the SRS. If the
air bag indicator is inoperative and a SRS fault exists, a chime will sound in a pattern of 5 sets of 5 beeps. If this occurs, the air bag indicator and any SRS fault discovered must be diagnosed and repaired.

<br>Clear all continuous DTCs from the restraints control module using a diagnostic tool.
