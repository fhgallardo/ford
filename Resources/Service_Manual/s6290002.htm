</h4><meta name="tps_proctitle" content="Exhaust System">

<p><b>Exhaust System
</b></p><p>The exhaust system provides an exit for exhaust gases and reduces engine noise by passing exhaust gases through the catalytic converter and a muffler assembly. Rubber exhaust hanger isolators attach the exhaust system to the mounting hooks.
</p><p><b>Catalytic Converter
</b></p><p>The catalytic converter plays a major role in the emission control system. The catalytic converter operates as a gas reactor. Its catalytic function is to speed the heat-producing chemical reaction of components in the exhaust gases in order to
reduce air pollutants. The catalyst material inside the catalytic converter consists of a ceramic substrate.
</p><p>The catalytic converter is designed to provide a long life. No maintenance is necessary for the catalytic converter.
</p><p><b>Sound Insulators and Shields
</b></p><p>Sound insulators and shields attached to the underbody protect the vehicle from exhaust system heat and should be inspected at regular intervals to make sure they are not dented or out of position. If a sound insulator and shield is damaged or
shows evidence of deterioration, a new sound insulator and shield should be installed. The sound insulators and shields for the muffler, exhaust downpipe, inlet pipe and catalytic converter pipe are installed separately.

Never work around or attempt to repair any part of the exhaust system until it has cooled. Use special care when working around the catalytic converter. The catalytic
converter heats to a high temperature after only a short period of engine operation. Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal injury.

Exhaust system leaks should be repaired immediately. Never operate the engine in enclosed areas. Failure to follow these instructions may result in
personal injury.

Lead reacts with platinum to "poison" the catalyst. Continuous use of leaded fuel can destroy the
catalyst and render the catalytic converter useless.

Do not continue to operate the vehicle if
the engine is misfiring, there is a power loss or other unusual operating conditions, such as engine overheating and backfiring.

These lubricants may cause deterioration of the rubber. This can lead to separation of the isolator from the exhaust hanger bracket during vehicle operation.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Exhaust fasteners are of a prevailing torque design. Use only new fasteners, coupler and exhaust intermediate pipe and clamp (whenever loosened or removed) with the same part number as the original. Torque values must be used as specified
during reassembly to make sure of correct retention of exhaust components.
</p><p>Apply anti-seize lubricant to the threads of the heated oxygen sensors (HO2S) and catalyst monitor sensor before installation.
