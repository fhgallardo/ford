<p><b>NOTE:
</b>  The frame must be straightened before any reinforcing can be started.
</p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Whenever factory E-coat has been removed by sanding, grinding or weld burn-off, the Anti-Corrosion coating must be restored.
</p>

<ol start="1"><li>After a bent frame member has been straightened, inspect the frame member closely for cracks. If any cracks show, the frame member should be reinforced or replaced. Reinforcements should be made from angle or flat stock of the same material and
thickness as the frame member being reinforced, and should extend to either side of the crack. Ideally, the reinforcement should be cut from the corresponding area of a similar frame.

<ol start="2"><li>Use a wire brush on the area around the crack to remove the paint, wax, grease or mud, etc., and expose the crack completely, this will make sure of good penetration.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>To stop the crack from spreading, drill a 6.35 mm (1/4 in) hole at a point 12.5 mm (1/2 in) beyond the root of the crack.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li>Grind out the full length of the crack to the hole to form a V-shaped slot with the base of the V-slot contacting the reinforcement.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>The base of the V-slot should have at least a 1.5 mm (0.06 in) opening to make sure of weld penetration to the reinforcement when welding the crack.
</li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Be sure to weld the V-slot first, then metal finish the area, before installation of the reinforcement.
</p>Drill clearance holes in the reinforcements to clear rivet heads or nuts where necessary.
</li></ol>

<ol start="7"><li>In the event that a repair is required on more than one frame surface (for example, a flange crack that extends into the web), 2 pieces of flat stock should be welded together where they join. The web reinforcement should be a minimum of 76.2
mm (3.0 in) high and have a 63.5 mm (2.54 in) radius at each of the 2 corners.
</li></ol>

<ol start="8"><li>Completely clean the surface of the frame under and around the reinforcements.
</li></ol>

<ol start="9"><li>Clamp the reinforcements securely to the frame prior to welding. Continuously weld the reinforcement over the welded V-slot repair.
</li></ol>

<ol start="10"><li>Grind the flange edge weld until smooth after all pit holes have been filled by the weld.
</li></ol>

<ol start="11"><li>If a damaged bracket is to be replaced, make sure the new bolts, washers and nuts are of the same specifications and bolt torque as the original parts.
