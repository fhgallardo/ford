<p><b>Inspection and Verification
</b></p><p>Certain axle and driveline symptoms are also common to the engine, transmission, wheel bearings, tires and other parts of the vehicle. For this reason, be sure that the cause of the concern is in the axle before disassembling, adjusting or
repairing the axle. Refer to

<p><b>Noise Acceptability
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  A gear-driven unit will produce a certain amount of noise. Some noise is acceptable and audible at certain speeds or under various driving conditions such as a newly paved blacktop road. Slight noise is not detrimental to the operation of the
axle and is considered normal.
</p><p>With the limited slip differential axle, slight chatter noise on slow turns after extended highway driving is considered acceptable and has no detrimental effect on the locking axle function.

</p><div><a name="extract_176">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Analysis of Leakage
</b></p><p>Clean up the leaking area enough to identify the exact source. An axle leak can be caused by the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Axle lubricant level is too high
</li><li>Worn or damaged axle shaft seals or differential seals
</li><li>Differential housing is cracked
</li><li>Flange yoke seal is worn or damaged
</li><li>Pinion flange is scored or damaged
</li><li>Axle cover is not sealed
</li><li>Vent is plugged
</li></ul><p>Repair the axle as necessary. Make sure the axle lubricant is at the correct level. Refer to Specifications in this section.
</p><p><b>Axle Vent
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  If a plugged vent cannot be cleared, install a new one.
</p><p>A plugged vent will cause excessive seal lip wear due to internal pressure buildup. If a leak occurs, check the vent. Make sure the vent hose is not kinked. Remove the hose from the vent nipple and clear the hose of any foreign material. While
the hose is removed, pass a length of mechanic's wire or a small diameter Allen wrench in and out of the vent to clean it. Connect the hose when done.
</p><p><b>Flange Yoke Seal
</b></p><p>Leaks at the axle drive pinion seal originate for the following reasons:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Seal was not correctly installed.
</li><li>Poor quality seal journal surface.
</li></ul><p>Any damage to the seal bore (dings, dents, gouges or other imperfections) will distort the seal casing and allow leakage past the outer edge of the axle drive pinion seal.
</p><p>The axle drive pinion seal can be torn, cut or gouged if it is not installed carefully. The spring that holds the axle drive pinion seal against the pinion flange can be knocked out and allow leakage past the lip.
</p><p>The rubber lips can occasionally become hard (like plastic) with cracks at the oil lip contact point. The contact point on the pinion flange may blacken, indicating excessive heat. Marks, nicks, gouges or rough surface texture on the seal
journal of the pinion flange will also cause leaks.
</p><p>A new pinion flange must be installed if any of these conditions exist.
</p><p>Metal chips or sand trapped at the sealing lip can also cause oil leaks. This can cause a wear groove on the pinion flange and heavy pinion seal wear.
</p><p>If a seal leak occurs, install a new seal and check the vent and the vent hose to make sure they are clean and free of foreign material.
</p><p><b>Axle Shaft Seals
</b></p><p>Axle shaft oil seals are susceptible to the same kinds of damage as axle drive pinion seals if incorrectly installed. The seal bore must be clean and the lip handled carefully to avoid cutting or tearing it. The axle shaft journal surface must
be free of nicks, gouges and rough surface texture. Refer to

</b></p><p>Most vibration is caused by tires, driveline angle or driveline imbalance.
</p><p>Vibration is a concern with modern, high-mileage tires if they are not "true" both radially and laterally. They are more susceptible to vibration around the limits of radial and lateral runout of the tire and wheel assembly. They also require
more accurate balancing. Wheel and tire runout checks, truing and balancing are normally done before axle inspection. Refer to

</p><p><b>Driveline Imbalance
</b></p><p>Driveline imbalance can be caused by excessive looseness in the driveshaft, damaged driveshaft tubing, looseness or high runout at the driveshaft attachments (axle and transfer case flanges). Excessive looseness in the driveshaft can be caused
by CV joint or universal joint wear as well as loose-fitting slip-yoke splines. Inspect and install new driveshaft and halfshaft components as necessary. Refer to

</a>.
</p><p>The noises described below usually have specific causes that can be diagnosed through observation as the unit is disassembled. The initial clues are the type of noise heard during the road test.
</p><p><b>Gear Howl and Whine
</b></p><h5>Bearing Whine
</h5><p>Howling or whining of the ring gear and pinion is due to an incorrect gear pattern, gear damage or incorrect bearing preload.
</p><p>Bearing whine is a high-pitched sound similar to a whistle. It is usually caused by worn/damaged pinion bearings. Bearing noise occurs at all driving speeds. This distinguishes it from gear whine, which usually comes and goes as speed changes.
</p><p>As noted, pinion bearings make a high-pitched, whistling noise, usually at all speeds. If, however, there is only one pinion bearing that is worn/damaged, the noise may vary in different driving phases. Pinion bearings must not be installed new
unless they are scored or damaged, or there is a specific pinion bearing noise. A worn/damaged bearing will normally be obvious at disassembly. Examine the large end of the rollers for wear. If the original blend radius of the pinion bearing has
worn to a sharp edge, a new pinion bearing must be installed.
</p><p>A wheel bearing noise can be mistaken for a pinion bearing noise. On rear wheel drive (RWD) vehicles, check the wheel bearing for a spalled cup and spalled/damaged rollers. Install a new wheel bearing if any of these concerns are detected.

Install a new axle shaft if any damage is detected.
</p><IMG src="ge0790a.gif"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        height="174" width="269" border="1"><p>On four wheel drive (4WD) vehicles, check the wheel bearing for rotating smoothness and end play. Install new as required.
</p><h5>Bearing Rumble
</h5><p>Bearing rumble sounds like marbles being tumbled. This condition is usually caused by a worn/damaged wheel bearing. The lower pitch is because the wheel bearing turns at only about 1/3 of the driveshaft speed. Wheel bearing noise also may be
high-pitched, similar to gear noise, but will be evident in all 4 driving modes.
</p><p><b>Axle Shaft Bearing Noise
</b></p><p>Axle shaft bearing noise is similar to gear noise and differential pinion bearing whine. Axle shaft bearing noise will usually distinguish itself from gear noise by occurring in all driving modes (drive, coast and float), and will persist with
the transmission in NEUTRAL while the vehicle is moving at the speed in which the concern is occurring. If the vehicle makes this noise, remove the suspect axle shaft, install a new bearing and a new axle seal. Re-evaluate the vehicle for noise
before removing any internal components.
</p><p><b>Chuckle
</b></p><p>Chuckle that occurs on the coast driving phase is usually caused by excessive clearance between the differential gear hub and the differential case bore.
</p><p>Damage to a gear tooth on the coast side can cause a noise identical to a chuckle. A very small tooth nick or ridge on the edge of a tooth can cause the noise.
</p><p>Clean the gear tooth nick or ridge with a small grinding wheel. If the damaged area is larger than 3.2 mm (1/8 inch), install a new gearset.
</p><p>To check the ring gear and pinion, remove as much lubricant as possible from the gears with clean solvent. Wipe the gears dry or blow them dry with compressed air. Look for scored or damaged teeth. Also look for cracks or other damage.
</p><p>If either gear is scored or damaged badly, a new ring gear and pinion must be installed.

At this time, any other damaged parts in the axle housing must also be installed new.
</p><p><b>Knock
</b></p><p>Knock, which can occur on all driving phases, has several causes including damaged teeth or gearset.

</b>  Measure the end play with a Dial Indicator with Bracketry, not by feel.
</p>Knock is also caused by excessive end play in the axle shafts. Up to 0.762 mm (0.030 inch) is allowed in semi-float axles. The frequency of the knock will be less because the axle shaft speed is slower than the driveshaft.
</li></ol><p><b>Clunk
</b></p><p>Clunk is a metallic noise heard when the automatic transmission is engaged in REVERSE or DRIVE. The noise can also occur when throttle is applied or released. It is caused by backlash somewhere in the driveline or loose suspension components.
It is felt or heard in the axle. Refer to Total Backlash Check in this section.
</p><p>Additionally, clunk may be heard upon initial drive-away. This occurs as engine torque shifts vehicle weight, forcing changes in driveline angles, preventing the driveshaft slip-yoke from sliding on the output shaft. To correct this condition,
lubricate the slip-yoke splines. Refer to

<p><b>Analysis of Inoperative Conditions
</b></p><p>If the axle does not operate, one of the following may be the cause:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Broken welds. If axle housing welds are completely broken, install a new axle housing.
</li><li>Wheel bearing wear/damage. Because of the severe loads they must handle, new wheel bearings may need to be installed at high mileage. If a wheel bearing fails at low mileage, it is often caused by overloading.

<p><b>Driveshaft Vibration Diagnosis
</b></p><ol start="1"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When carrying out the following procedure steps on four wheel drive (4WD) vehicles, raise and support the vehicle so that all 4 wheels do not touch the ground.
</p>Road test the vehicle to determine the critical vibration points. Note the road speed, the engine rpm, and the shift lever positions at which the vibration occurs.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Stop the vehicle, place the transmission lever in NEUTRAL and run the engine through the critical speed ranges determined in Step 1.
</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>If no vibration is felt, balance the driveshaft. Refer to Driveline Vibration in this section.
</li></ol><div><a name="extract_184">&nbsp;

<p><b>Driveline Vibration
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  An analysis of driveline vibration can also be conducted using the Vibration Analyzer, following the manufacturer's directions.
</p><p>Driveline vibration exhibits a higher frequency and lower amplitude than does high-speed shake. Driveline vibration is directly related to the speed of the vehicle and is usually noticed at various speeds. Driveline vibration can be perceived
as a tremor in the floorpan or heard as a rumble, hum or boom. Driveline vibration can exist in all drive modes, but may exhibit different symptoms depending upon whether the vehicle is accelerating, decelerating, floating or coasting. Check the
driveline angles if the vibration is particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration, especially at lower speeds. Driveline vibration can be duplicated by supporting the axle on a hoist or jack stands, though the brakes may need to be
applied lightly to simulate road resistance.
</p><ol start="1"><li>After reviewing the customer complaint, operate the vehicle and verify the condition. Do not make adjustments before carrying out a road test and a thorough visual inspection of the vehicle. Write down anything that does not look right. Do not
change the tire pressure or the vehicle load. This may reduce the intensity of the condition to a point at which it cannot be identified clearly. Road test the vehicle and define the condition by reproducing it several times during the road test.
During the road test:
</li></ol><ul type="disc"><li>A tachometer must be used.
</li><li>Note the fuel level.
</li><li>Note the vehicle speed, engine rpm and transmission gear used when the concern is present.
</li><li>Find the speed at which the concern is most severe. Accelerate gently through this speed to 8 km/h (5 mph) above it. Then coast down 8 km/h (5 mph) below it. Note if the concern changes.
</li><li>Drive the vehicle 8 km/h (5 mph) above the speed. Place the vehicle in NEUTRAL. Let the vehicle coast down. Note any changes.
</li><li>Accelerate gently through this speed to 8 km/h (5 mph) above it. Disengage OVERDRIVE. It is important to evaluate rear axle vibration/noise concerns in DIRECT DRIVE rather than overdrive.
</li><li>Maintain the speed at which the concern occurs. Note if the concern changes.
</li><li>"Float" the driveline by easing off slightly on the accelerator at which the condition occurs. This is to unload the axle gears and universal joints.
</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Analyze the results of the road test. The concern should be directly related to vehicle road speed, not affected by acceleration or deceleration, or could not be reduced by coasting in NEUTRAL. The concern is independent of engine speed, and
occurred at the same speed in any gear. If the concern does not change in all these modes of operation, the cause can be attributed to one of these typical causes of high speed vibrations:
</li></ol><ul type="disc"><li>Excessive tire/wheel imbalance
</li><li>Excessive tire/wheel runout
</li><li>Brake disc or drum imbalance
</li><li>Driveshaft imbalance
</li><li>Pinion flange runout or imbalance
</li><li>Galled, dirty, rusty, incorrectly lubricated, damaged or worn slip yoke splines or U-joints
</li><li>Rear axle ring and pinion (gear pitch line runout)
</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  When carrying out the following procedure steps on four wheel drive (4WD) vehicles, raise and support the vehicle so that all 4 wheels do not touch the ground.
</p>Raise and support the vehicle on a twin post hoist immediately (to prevent tire flat-spotting) after the road test. Using a frame hoist will change driveline angles. On 4WD vehicles, make sure the 4WD selector is in the RWD mode. Engage the
driveline and accelerate to the observed road test speed to verify the presence of a vibration. If the vibration can be duplicated on the hoist, proceed to driveshaft inspection, Step 5. If the vibration does not occur, proceed as follows:

<ul type="disc"><li>Carry out a careful visual inspection of the tire and wheels for wear or damage. Verify that the correct tire size and wheel rim is used. Verify that the tire pressure is correct. Refer to the tire manufacturer's specifications for the correct
pressures. If a tire or wheel is damaged, carry out a careful visual inspection of the front or rear suspension components. The suspension can be worn, damaged or misaligned, contributing to the tire or wheel damage. Check the balance of the tires
and wheels without the removal of the factory weights. Check the non-drive wheels first, and then the drive wheels. Repair as necessary. Repeat the road test. If a vibration still exists, proceed to Step 4.
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="4"><li>Check the tire and wheel radial runout measurements with a dial indicator or tire runout gauge.
</li></ol><ul type="disc"><li>Place the stem of the gauge in a smooth area as close to the center tread as possible.
</li><li>Rotate the tire to locate the low spot. Zero the indicator. Turn the tire and mark the high spot. Acceptable radial runout is 1.14 mm (0.045 inch) or less.
</li><li>If the tire radial runout exceeds specification, check the wheel runout.
</li><li>Place the stem of the gauge on the wheel outer diameter or bead seat.
</li><li>Rotate the wheel to locate the low spot. Zero the indicator. Turn the wheel and mark the high spot. Acceptable wheel radial runout is 0.9 mm (0.035 inch) or less. Install a new tire or wheel as necessary.

Rotate the driveshaft slowly by hand and feel for binding or end play in the U-joint trunnions. Check the index marks (yellow paint) on the rear
driveshaft and the pinion flange. If the marks are not aligned, disconnect the driveshaft and realign the marks as close as possible. Remove and inspect the slip yoke splines for any galling, dirt, rust or incorrect lubrication. Clean the driveshaft
or install new U-joints as necessary. Install a new driveshaft if damaged. After any corrections or new components are installed, recheck for the vibration at the road test speed. If the vibration is gone, reinstall the tires and wheel and test
drive. If the vibration persists or the driveshaft passes visual inspection, proceed to Step 6.
</li></ol><ol start="6"><li>Using a dial indicator, measure the driveshaft at the front, center and rear. Rotate the shaft using a brake drum or brake disc rotor. If the runout exceeds 0.76 mm (0.030 in) at the front or center, install a new driveshaft. If the front and
center is within specification, but the rear runout is not, index mark the rear runout high point and proceed to Step 7. If the runout is within specification at all points, balance the driveshaft.

Disconnect the driveshaft and rotate it 180 degrees. Reinstall the driveshaft. Recheck the runout at the driveshaft rear. If the runout is still over 0.76 mm (0.030 in), mark the high point and
proceed to Step 8. If the runout is within specification, check for the vibration at the road speed. If the vibration is still present, proceed to Step 9 to balance the driveshaft.
</li></ol><ol start="8"><li>Excessive driveshaft runout can originate in the driveshaft itself. To find the source, compare the 2 high points previously determined. If the index marks are close together, within 25 mm (1 in), the driveshaft is eccentric. Install a new
driveshaft. Recheck the driveshaft at the road test speed.
</li></ol><p>If the marks are on opposite sides of the driveshaft, 180 degrees apart, the slip yoke or pinion flange is responsible. Check the pinion flange runout. Refer to Pinion Flange Runout in this section. Install a new pinion flange as necessary.
