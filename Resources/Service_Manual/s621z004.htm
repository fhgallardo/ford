</TD></TR></TABLE><br><p>The correct equipment and settings must be used when welding mild or high strength steel. Metal inert gas (MIG) and squeeze-type resistance spot welding (STRW) are the preferred methods. Surfaces must be clean and free of foreign materials.
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Correct eye protection must be worn.
</li><li>The correct protective clothing should always be worn.
</li><li>Adequate ventilation must be provided to avoid accumulation of poisonous gases.
</li><li>A test weld should always be carried out on a test sample.
</li><li>Follow equipment manufacturer's prescribed procedures and equipment settings for the type of weld being used.
</li><li>Disconnect the battery ground cable from the battery.
</li><li>Disconnect on-vehicle modules and protect them from possible heat damage and electrical currents when welding.
</li><li>Use grinding discs and wire brushes dedicated to the type of material being welded.
</li><li>Follow equipment manufacturer's prescribed procedures and equipment settings for the type of weld being used. ER70S-2 or ER70S-6 wire are typically used for MIG welding steel.
</li><li>Components made of high-strength steel should not be heated to straighten or repair. Severely bent or kinked components should be replaced with new ones.
</li><li>Factory spot welds may be substituted with either resistance spot welds or MIG plug welds. Spot/plug welds should equal factory welds in both location and quantity. Do not place a new spot weld directly over an original weld location. Plug weld
hole should equal 8 mm (0.31 in) diameter.
</li></ul><p>Arc welding is an acceptable method for welding heavier metal components such as frame parts. When arc welding, the following guidelines should be followed:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Attach the ground clamp as close as possible to the work area.
</li><li>Choose welding electrodes according to the type of steel, thickness and polarity of the arc welder (AC or DC).
</li><li>Do not use water or compressed air to cool welding. This can cause the metal to become brittle and weak.
</li><li>Corrosion protection needs to be restored whenever it is necessary to sand or grind through painted surfaces or E-coat, or when bare metal repairs are carried out. Refer to
