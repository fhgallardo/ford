every collision. All new belt assemblies should be installed unless a qualified technician finds the assemblies show no damage and operate correctly. Belt assemblies not in use during a collision should also be inspected and new assemblies installed
if either damage or incorrect operation is noted. Failure to follow these instructions could increase the risk of injury in collisions.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE:
</b>  Safety belt assemblies should be periodically inspected to make sure they have not become damaged and that they remain in correct operating condition, particularly if they have been subjected to severe stress.

<p>Before installing the new safety belt assembly, the safety belt attaching areas must be inspected for damage and distortion. If the attaching points are damaged and distorted, the sheet metal must be reworked back to its original shape and
structural integrity.
</p></p>Install the new safety belt(s) using the appropriate instructions. Perform the Functional Test.
